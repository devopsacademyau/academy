This non-profit repository intention is to help the community to learn the DevOps methodology and culture throughout a series of classes and hands-on laboratories and become ready to start working as Automation/Cloud/DevOps Engineer.

Feel free to contribute with content (PR), help peer reviewing code or just going through the exercises!

If you want to make part of the team behind this, get in touch on help@devopsacademy.com.au.

# How it Works

To complete the DevOps Academy, you will have to go through 8 classes with hands-on exercises. For each exercise, you will have to submit your code via pull requests to this repository as per [instructions](#exercises). The last two labs are complete projects based on current industry needs.

You will also be required to peer review at least 5 pull requests from other students to finish this course.

## Exercises

For each class **exercise**:
1. Clone this repository
   
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
- [OR fork it to your own GitHub account and clone from there](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)

2. Switch to **master** branch and **pull** it 

3. Create a new branch **from master** with branch name containing exercise number and your name, e.g `<github-username>/<exercise-number>` 

```bash
git checkout -b caiocezart/c01-e01
```
4. create a folder with your `<github-username>` (e.g. `denstorti`, `kikobr82`, ...)

```bash
cd <repo-name>

mkdir classes/01class/exercises/c01-e01/<my-username>
```

5. Add your work on a folder like `classes/<class name>/exercises/<exercise-number>/<github-username>/`.

Exercise submissions can be textual like a simple .txt file or more complex containing several files and folders.

Example: 
`classes/01class/exercises/c01-e01/caiocezart/<my-files>`

6. Create one or more commits with changes for this exercise
7. Push it to the remote repo regularly
8. Only open a Pull Request with the name `<github-username>/<exercise-number>` ***when your work is ready to be reviewed***
9. Once you have the approvals, we will merge your code to **master** branch and complete the exercise. Congrats!
10. Upon completion of your first exercise, you will be given permission to start/help peer reviewing other community members code! 

### Example of the submission process
```bash
# starting with exercise1
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b "my_github_username/exercise1"
# code code code 
# Remember to add files inside the correct folder
# e.g. .../classes/01class/exercises/exercise1/<my_github_username>
git add file1 file2
git commit -m "comment about the changes on this commit"
# ... several commits later
git push origin "my_github_username/exercise1"
# ... several pushes later, when you are ready for a review
# Open a PR via Github website with the name 

# now, doing exercise2
git checkout master
# update your work directory from remote repo
git pull 
git checkout -b "my_github_username/exercise2"
...
...
```

### Available labs

## Projects

More info to come..

- [Project 01 - Application migration from on-prem to the cloud](projects/project01/README.md)
- [Project 02 - Cloud native application architecture on AWS](projects/project02/README.md)

Projects will be submitted in the respective project `submissions` folder via PRs.

Example:
`projects/project01/submissions/caiocezart/<my-files>`


# Contributors and Instructors

## Presentation format

* We are using plain README.md files with markdown or [GitPitch](https://gitpitch.com/docs/markdown-features/basics/) for slideshow presentations
* For GitPitch, use PITCHME.md files and subfolders using query string "p=FOLDERNAME" with the class name
* GitPitch can run either online (out-of-the-box for Github public repos):
    * Online: access `https://gitpitch.com/${ORG_NAME}/${REPO_NAME}/${BRANCH_NAME}?p=${FOLDER_NAME}`. Folder must contain a PITCHME.md file.
    * Offline: use a [Docker container](https://github.com/kns-it/Docker-GitPitch/), run `make presentation` and `open http://localhost:9000/${ORG_NAME}/${REPO_NAME}/${BRANCH_NAME}?p=${FOLDER_NAME}`
    For running in a specific folder: `FOLDER_NAME=class2 make presentation`
