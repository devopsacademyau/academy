1. Let's suppose you remotely pushed your my_env.txt file. A colleague asks you to remove this information from Git. What's your colleague worried about?
   The colleague is intending to prevent sensitive data being added into their repository.

2. If you modify the file in your workspace, then push it, will it be enough? (It's not). Why?
   No. Git history keeps every line written.

3. If you delete the file and push it, then create a new one with the rest of the information, is it enough? (It's not). Why?
   It is still not working, once you have commited your changes is going to be in the git history.

4. How to fix this? How do you remove something from Git history?
   I'd try to revert it by moving a branch backwards from 'index' layer (local) .

5. Which commands would you use? What are the consequences for other developers?
   - git reset HEAD~1
   - git rebase 
   These commands will combine all commits into a larger one. None of other developers will be affected.
