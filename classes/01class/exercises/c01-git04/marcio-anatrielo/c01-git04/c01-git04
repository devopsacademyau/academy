1) Let's suppose you remotely pushed your my_env.txt file. A colleague asks you to remove this information from Git. What's your colleague worried about?
   Besed on best practices it is not allow to publish any confidential information like password in a working repo where the development team have access. The best practices is add this file on limited access enviroment with have access control. 

2) If you modify the file in your workspace, then push it, will it be enough? (It's not). Why?
   No, because the password information will be available for some one with can have access through the repo logs.

3) If you delete the file and push it, then create a new one with the rest of the information, is it enough? (It's not). Why?
   No, it will create the same problem about security with we have see on last question. That information will be available on repo logs.

4) How to fix this? How do you remove something from Git history?
   Removing it from Git repo history using git reflog and git gc.

5) Which commands would you use? What are the consequences for other developers?
   In this case I would use git reflog and git gc:
   $ git reflog expire --expire=now --all
   $ git gc --prune=now

The consequence for other developers are that their branch will have a different hostory from your branch and this can couse some conflicts with your branch in future udpate.
