1. Let's suppose you remotely pushed your `my_env.txt` file. A colleague asks you to remove this information from Git. What's your colleague worried about? 
breach of sensitive information in file content

2. If you modify the file in your workspace, then push it, will it be enough? (It's not). Why?
no, because the file will still be on git history

3. If you delete the file and push it, then create a new one with the rest of the information, is it enough? (It's not). Why?
still no, as the old version of this file will still be on git history

4. How to fix this? How do you remove something from Git history?
you have to remove the file from history with git filter-branch command

5. Which commands would you use? What are the consequences for other developers?
git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch 'PATH-TO-YOUR-FILE-WITH-SENSITIVE-DATA' --prune-empty --tag-name-filter cat -- --all
or git rebase -i HEAD~'number_of_commits_to_right_back'

the other developers should rebase their repositories
