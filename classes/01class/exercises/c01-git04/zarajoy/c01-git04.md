    add my_env details
    
    
1. Let's suppose you remotely pushed the `my_env.txt` file above. A colleague asks you to remove this information from Git. What's your colleague worried about?

This information could be gained by people with access to the remote repo. It is not recommended to keep such sensitve info in plain text!!


2. If you modify the file in your workspace, then commit and push it, will it be enough to erase this password information from the repository? (It's not). Why?

No. It will still exist in log of past  commits.


3. If you delete the file and push it, then create a new one with the rest of the information, is it enough? (It's not). Why?

No. This is just adding a new commit into the history. The old commit is still present in log.


4. How to fix this? How do you remove something from Git history when it is in the remote repository?

5. Which commands would you use? Explain what the command does.
