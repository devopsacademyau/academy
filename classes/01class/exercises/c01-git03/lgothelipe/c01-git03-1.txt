Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?

Yes, before addind the big file it was 49K and after add a 100MB file it had 201MB.

What is the reason for this problem?

A copy of the file was stored on the history on the folder /.git/objects

How do you remove something from Git history? Which commands would you use? What are the consequences?

To remove the file from history use "git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD". 
To remove the local cache remove folder ".git". As a consequece, this procedure will permanently remove the file from the repository.
