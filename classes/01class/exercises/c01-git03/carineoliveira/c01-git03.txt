Class 01 - GitHub 03

- Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
Yes. The directory was 92K big when the first file were added and then 20M big when the second file were added.

- What is the reason for this problem?
The files were kept in the folder ./.git/objects for history even after the reset.

- How do you remove something from Git history? Which commands would you use? What are the consequences?

Execute the following command to remove undesired files:
git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD

Then force push the local repository to overwrite git repository and branches that were pushed:
git push origin --force --all

Consequences: 
- It removes the file permanently and it could be a problem when done by mistake making the file unable to recover.
