## Questions (answer inline)

1. Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?

Yes, from 96K to 20M after adding the big file, but once reverted the repo still had 10M.

2. What is the reason for this problem?

Because the big file still in the git history, because git tracks the whole history of the repo, it shows it had that big file once, and the reference of this file still there.


3. How do you remove something from Git history after it is pushed to the remote repository? Which commands would you use? 

git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD


If you want to push it to remote repo just do git push

git push -all --force

1. What are the consequences of the previous action?

It rewrites the whole history, which changes all the commit ids and will definately affect other users by losing syncronims of other users local and remote branches, all the git history commits will have different ids, so all their local work will be unable to be pushed to remote, they will have to update their local with the new history to be able to keep going using the same repository.
