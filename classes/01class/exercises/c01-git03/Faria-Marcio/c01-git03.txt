--Questions:
1) Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
	Yes, the repo size got bigger in 200MB.

2) What is the reason for this problem?
	A copy of the file was added /.git/objects 

3) How do you remove something from Git history? Which commands would you use? What are the consequences?
	Using the commands 'git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD', the file is removed from git history. Doing that, the file cannot be recovered/reached anymore.
