1. Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
   Yes, the size improves as commits are asked. It means that even if we remove the files from the project with a commit, the files still exist in the repository history.

2. What is the reason for this problem?
   It happens because git keeps track of each and every line change we made.

3. How do you remove something from Git history? Which commands would you use? What are the consequences?
   I'd try to identify all unused data and then clean them up or set the current commit as the initial commit of the project.
   - git count-objects -v (knowing what is the actual size of our repository)
   - git clone repo_name.git (taking backup of our git repository before re-writing the git history)
   - git gc (Finally, garbage collection will remove all data from the repository that is not actually used)
   The side effect is once we have re-written the git history, we cannot go back to any previous versions or commits.
