1. Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
   Yes, the size improves as commits are asked. It means that even if we remove the files from the project with a commit, the files still exist in the repository history.

2. What is the reason for this problem?
   It happens because git keeps track of each and every line change we made.

3. How do you remove something from Git history? Which commands would you use? What are the consequences?
   As the changes are in the remote repository, we will need to drop/remove the hash
   - git rebase -i HEAD~X
   - include drop in the line with the hash to be deleted 
   - git push --force
   The side effect is once we have re-written the git history, we cannot go back to any previous versions or commits.
