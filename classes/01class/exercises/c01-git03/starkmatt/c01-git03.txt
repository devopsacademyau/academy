Created a seperate local branch called git-e03 and created the readme file as well as the large file

[c01-git03 4f32a74] Adding bigger file

➜  starkmatt git:(c01-git03) ✗ cd ..
➜  c01-git03 git:(c01-git03) ✗ du -sh 
100K	.

I noticed that the file size when running du-sh at the time was 100K
After running du-sh again I saw the following
➜  starkmatt git:(c01-git03) ✗ du -sh .
84K	.

I believe it was because I added the "." indicating this location where as initally I didn't put the "."
I reverted the changes by typing;
 git log

And then identifying the commit by the ID and then typing

git revert 4f32a74a68991551b2d8d1bfbec1b8dd03fbefc1

Confimed that the file had been removd by reverting the last commit
➜  starkmatt git:(c01-git) ✗ ls -l
total 4
-rw-r----- 1 root root 1326 Feb 14 02:02 c01-e03.txt
-rw-r----- 1 root root    0 Feb 14 01:35 README.md
➜  starkmatt git:(c01-git) ✗ du -sh .
8.0K	.

I then ran du -h on the Repo

34M	./academy

Questions

- I believe that this can be an issue if a big file is created in the teams local repo and then merged to the master without doublechecking.
The file size of the repo may increase and then cause issues when other team members are pulling changes to their repos.

- To remove git history, it would be ideal to use git rebase, as it is a clean commit and free of unnecessary merge commits
