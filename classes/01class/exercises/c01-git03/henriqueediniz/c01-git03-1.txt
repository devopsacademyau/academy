Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
Yes, I notice that the before the new file was added repo size was 100K and after added it 
had 213M.

What is the reason for this problem?
The 'git add' command added a copy of the file in the folder ./.git/objects. 

How do you remove something from Git history? Which commands would you use? What are the consequences?
To remove something from git history we can use the follow command 'git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD'. 
As a consequece, this procedure will permanently remove the file from the repository.
