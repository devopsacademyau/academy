Q: Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
A: Yeah. It became approximately 20MB bigger

Q: What is the reason for this problem?
A: Git stores a copy of the additions/changes inside the .git folder

Q: How do you remove something from Git history? Which commands would you use? What are the consequences?
A: Using the commands below:

To completely remove files from the repository

$ git filter-branch --force --index-filter \
  "git rm --cached --ignore-unmatch <FILE_TO_DELETE>" \
  --prune-empty --all

To remove a secret from a configuration file

$ git filter-branch --tree-filter \
  "sed -i 's/12hgjg324g23g413gjh1234/AWS_TOKEN/g' secrets.json" \
  --all
