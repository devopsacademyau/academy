1. Did you notice any difference in the size of the repo before and after adding the big file?
Yes. The repo size was more than what I expected after I added the big file (eg increase in size was more than the size of the file i added). 

2. What is the reason for this problem?
A copy of the file was stored on the history on the folder /.git/objects with the 'git add file.txt; git commit -m "Add big file"' command

3. How do you remove something from Git history after it is pushed to the remote repository? Which commands would you use? 
git filter-branch --index-filter "git rm -rf --cached --ignore-unmatch path_to_file" HEAD

4. What are the consequences of the previous action?
you cannot reverse the removal. you should probably make a back up of the repo somewhere.
