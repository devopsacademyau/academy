Public IP:

I access the EC2 console and with help of documentation I made a configuration of my first instance. I create one Image of Amazon Linux AMI with a default VPC and I create a security group called Henrique Security Group to allows SSH with Key pairs that I create before named as myKey.

My terminal:

âœ¦ ðŸ‘½ henriquediniz ssh -i "myKey.pem" ec2-user@ec2-34-238-83-178.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Last login: Fri Feb  7 12:07:15 2020 from 155.143.178.112

Private IP: 

To access my other instance, I did not flag Assign IPs automatically as private and used the same configuration as the last instance, however, I have to create an elastic IP associated with my private IP to be accessed from within the VPC using the internal IP .

I used this steps:

- Go into the EC2 dashboard, then in the NETWORK & SECURITY menu go to Elastic IPs.
- Click on Allocate a new address.
- Right click on the new IP and select Associate address.
- Associate it with your EC2 instance that doesn't have an elastic IP.


My terminal: 

âœ¦ ðŸ‘½ henriquediniz ssh -i "myKey.pem" ec2-user@ec2-52-205-249-95.compute-1.amazonaws.com
