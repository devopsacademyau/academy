Creating a new Instance with Public IP adress:

1. Read EC2 from AWS documentation.

2. Followed the steps from “Setting Up with Amazon EC2”. 
-	First two steps already done (signed up for AWS, created IAM user),
-	Created and named a Key pair using my AWS Management Console,
-	Detected my default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC),
-	Created and named a new Security Group using the Amazon EC2 console. Default VPC was selected.

3. Followed steps to launch a new Instance through EC2 console:
-	Chose a “Free tier eligible.” AMI
-	Selected my newly created Security group
-	Selected existing key pair
-	Instance running
-	Done Status Check

4. Connecting the instance to SSH:
-	Followed the General Prerequisites for Connecting to Your Instance from AWS documentation. 
-	Verified, typing ssh on command line. 
-	Got detailed information about the Instance (AWS CLI) 
-	The security group created by the launch instance wizard enabled SSH traffic by default.
-	Got path to the location of private key.
-	Set permissions of my private key. 
o	chmod 400 /Users/denisegomes/Downloads/denise_admin_keypair3.pem
-	Didn’t opt for the instance’s fingerprint. 
-	Connected using my instance’s public DNS:
o	ssh -A -i /Users/denisegomes/Downloads/denise_admin_keypair3.pem ec2-user@ec2-3-104-38-234.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
(-A is to forward the keypair)

Creating a new Instance with Private IP:

1. Steps 1-3 as above, 

2. Selected same key pair at the launch of the Instance. 

3. On launching the instance,
- Instead of “Review and Launch”, I went to ‘next: Configure instance details.
- Chose a subnet from the list. 
- In the “Network interfaces” section, entered the custom private IPv4 address. Left as “Auto-assign” because according to documentation: “*Network interfaces*: For *Primary IP*, enter a private IPv4 address from the range of your subnet, or leave *Auto-assign* to let AWS choose a private IPv4 address for you.”
- Auto-Assign Public IP: DISABLED, not to assign a public IP address to the instance.
- Selected the previously created Security group
- Launched Instance
o Instance:  i-03235cb3e40dada4c Private IP: 172.31.5.11

4. Connected the first instance, then once connected: 
o	ssh  ec2-user@172.31.5.11 
- Private instance was successfully connected.
 

P.s. Followed AWS to assign a custom primary private IP address from https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/custom-private-primary-address-ec2/
The info about auto-assign Public IP to Disable was missing.
