Creating a new Instance with Public IP adress:

1. Read EC2 from AWS documentation.

2. Followed the steps from “Setting Up with Amazon EC2”. 
-	First two steps already done (signed up for AWS, created IAM user),
-	Created and named a Key pair using my AWS Management Console,
-	Detected my default Virtual Private Cloud (VPC),
-	Created and named a new Security Group using the Amazon EC2 console. Default VPC was selected.

3. Followed steps to launch a new Instance through EC2 console:
-	Chose a “Free tier eligible.” AMI
-	Selected my newly created Security group
-	Selected existing key pair
-	Instance running
-	Done Status Check

4. Connecting the instance to SSH:
-	Followed the General Prerequisites for Connecting to Your Instance from AWS documentation. 
-	Verified, typing ssh on command line. 
-	Got detailed information about the Instance (AWS CLI) 
-	The security group created by the launch instance wizard enabled SSH traffic by default.
-	Got path to the location of private key.
-	Set permissions of my private key. 
o	chmod 400 /Users/denisegomes/Downloads/denise_admin_keypair.pem
-	Didn’t opt for the instance’s fingerprint. 
-	Connected using my instance’s public DNS:
o	ssh -i /Users/denisegomes/Downloads/denise_admin_keypair.pem ec2-user@ec2-13-55-22-176.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Creating a new Instance with Private IP:

1. Steps 1-3 as above, 

2. Created a new key pair at the launch of the Instance (for trying this other option) 

3. On launching the instance,

- Instead of “Review and Launch”, I went to ‘next: Configure instance details.
- Chose a subnet from the list. 
- In the “Network interfaces” section, entered the custom private IPv4 address. Left as “Auto-assign” because according to documentation: “*Network interfaces*: For *Primary IP*, enter a private IPv4 address from the range of your subnet, or leave *Auto-assign* to let AWS choose a private IPv4 address for you.”

- Selected the previously created Security group
- Created a new key pair, named it. 
- Launched Instance
- Connected using a SSH client and my instance’s public DNS.

P.s. Followed AWS to assign a custom primary private IP address from https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/custom-private-primary-address-ec2/
but not sure if it worked as expected. Instanced launched but still showing a Public IP address as well…
