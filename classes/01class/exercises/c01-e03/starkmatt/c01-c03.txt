## Creating Public EC2 Instance
Public EC2 Instance was quite self explanatory, selected the Free Tier stuff and created my Instance in the Sydney Region, before hand I had selected North Virginia
Enabled Public auto assign IP and shh'd into the Public instance via my Shell using the ssh -i "<KEY>.pem"

## Creating Private EC2 Instance and SSH

I found that this was taking alot of time, but eventually figured it out.
Please see the steps below 


#Inital Error
From my public EC2 Instance

[ec2-user@ip-172-31-6-129 ~]$ ssh ec2-user@172.31.12.135
Permission denied (publickey).

#Installed Cert
ssh-keygen -t rsa -f starkmatt-box.pem

#Tried This Methodology First
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securely-connect-to-linux-instances-running-in-a-private-amazon-vpc/
Didn't work

#Tried to Run
aws ec2-instance-connect send-ssh-public-key --region ap-southeast-2 --instance-id i-0722634acb4320a09 --availability-zone ap-southeast-2a --instance-os-user ec2-user --ssh-public-key file://starkmatt-box.pem.pub

As Per Documentation 
https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/new-using-amazon-ec2-instance-connect-for-ssh-access-to-your-ec2-instances/

Created IAM User with correct region.

And then recieved,
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-6-129 ~]$ ssh ec2-user@172.31.12.135
Permission denied (publickey).

#Checked Public Key in
/home/ec2-user and edited <cert>.pem file with key associated to my PC

SSH'd again and recieved 

Permissions 0664 for '<certkey>.pem' are too open.
It is required that your private key files are NOT accessible by others.
This private key will be ignored.
Load key "<certkey>.pem": bad permissions
Permission denied (publickey).

Ran chmod 600 <certkey>.pem

and then
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-6-129 ~]$ ssh -i starkmatt-box-dm.pem ec2-user@172.31.12.135
