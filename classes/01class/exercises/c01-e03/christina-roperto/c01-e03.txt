##Creating EC2 instance using Public IP address
* created EC2 instance via console 
* Chose the free tier stuff, in this case Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type
* Enabled auto assign public IP
* Clicked connect from the console on my public machine
* Downloaded the credentials and connected via ssh using command below:
    > chmod 400 Christina AWS.pem
    > ssh -i "Christina AWS.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-211-212-190.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com


##Creating EC2 instance using Private IP address
* Same thing with public but disable auto assign public IP
* Since it's private and I couldn't connect it, I had to connect it through the public instance created previously using -A option (agent forwarding)
    > ssh -A -i ChristinaAWS.pem ec2-user@ec2-13-211-212-190.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
    > ssh  ec2-user@172.31.4.38
