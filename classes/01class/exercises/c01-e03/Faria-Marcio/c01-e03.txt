PUBLIC IP ADDRESS EC2:

1- On EC2 services I clicked on Launch Instance button;
2- Chose the default Amazon Machine Image (AMI), which was Amazon Linux;
3- Chose t2.micro instance type;
4- Configured the instance to Auto-assign Public IP, to access through SSH, and launched it;
5- Created a new key pair (AWS_-_Devops_KeyPair.pem);
6- On Ubuntu I accessed the instance through ssh -i "Devops_KeyPair.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-54-19-240.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com;


PRIVATE IP ADDRESS EC2:

- Steps 1, 2, 3 of Public IP Address, I disabled Auto-assign Public IP option and launched the EC2 instance;
4- Using WinSCP I uploaded the "Devops_KeyPair.pem" file to the public instance;
5- On Ubuntu I accessed the private instance using ssh -i "Devops_KeyPair.pem" ec2-user@172.31.14.171 command through the public instance;
