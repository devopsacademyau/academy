1) - How did you connected to the first public instance; 

	This instance I just select public subnet to be available on public IP by auto.

2) - Private IP of the instance on private subnet; 

	I select private network with no public IP after install. After that I add a new interface on my public VM with the same subnet on my private subnet to create a connection between this two VMs.


3) - How did you connected from public to private: 
	
Add new interface on public machine to talk at same subnet with my private machine is connected.
