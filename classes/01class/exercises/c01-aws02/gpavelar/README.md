ASSUMEROLEPOLICYDOCUMENT 2012-10-17
STATEMENT sts:AssumeRole Allow
PRINCIPAL ec2.amazonaws.com
```

`Role-Read-Trust-Policy.json` file used:

```json

  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": { "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com" },

}
```

```bash

## Creating my own policy
aws iam create-policy --policy-name AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_test \
--policy-document  file://my-own-s3-policy.json

# output

## Attach a managed policy to an IAM role
aws iam attach-role-policy --role-name Test-Role --policy-arn arn:aws:iam::478433196210:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_test
# output
NONE

```

`my-own-s3-policy.json`

```json

      "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::mydevops-bucket", "arn:aws:s3:::mydevops-bucket/*"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Changing wrong policies problems and remove policy from IAM ROLE

```bash
## Listing Attached policies
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name Test-Role

# output
ATTACHEDPOLICIES        arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess  AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
ATTACHEDPOLICIES        arn:aws:iam::478433196210:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_test    AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_test

## Detach Old policy
## Detaching role from policy
aws iam detach-role-policy \
--role-name Test-Role \
--policy-arn arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess
# output
NONE

## Listing Attached policies
aws iam list-attached-role-policies --role-name Test-Role

# output
ATTACHEDPOLICIES        arn:aws:iam::478433196210:policy/AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_test    AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess_test

## Now, checking informations
aws iam list-access-keys

# output
ACCESSKEYMETADATA       AKI************    2020-06-08T15:50:08+00:00       Active  develop
```

- Commands to copy the S3 file to a folder inside the instace (executed from inside the EC2 Instance):

```bash

### I'm already inside the EC2 instance, because I accessed it via SSH in the previous exercise.
mkdir testing-dir
aws s3 cp s3://mydevops-bucket/devops-classes/devops-aws.txt testing-dir

# output
download: s3://mydevops-bucket/devops-classes/devops-aws.txt to ./testing-dir
## If i want to keep the same-directory from s3 bucket
## I should use the following command
aws s3 sync s3://mydevops-bucket/devops-classes/ devops-classes
download: s3://mydevops-bucket/devops-classes/devops-aws.txt to devops-classes/devops-aws.txt

```

- Add a brief description of the challenges you faced:

1. Execut the aws s3 sync
   It was not syncing my file to s3 bucket. So I prefered to use `aws s3 cp <local> <s3>` instead.

```bash
## output
aws s3 sync "devops-classes/devops-rules.txt" s3://mydevops-bucket/devops-classes
warning: Skipping file /home/devops-classes/devops-rules.txt/. File does not exist.

```

2. Documentation
   It seems to be simple when you already know how to do some tasks and steps. But There are a lot of details that you must know to accomplish some tasks on aws services.

3. Policy to Create role
   Find the correct policy file to allow create a example user. I mean, find the JSON file from each policy. But It was solved in the last class when Denis gave an example.

## S3 (C01-aws02)

- Use the CLI to create a S3 bucket and upload a file to it.
- Access the file on the S3 bucket from any the EC2 instance created in the previous exercise.
- Submit a PR to the DevOpsAcademy repo under the `/classes/01class/exercises/c01-aws02/<github-username>` folder of this class with a brief description of what you did to achieve this objective. The file containing the solution you used must be named README.md

## Submit a PR with the folowing file:

- README.md based on the [ANSWER.md](ANSWER.md) file with the commands requested.

### Tip:

You can access the file on the S3 bucket by creating an IAM role with a S3 policy(you can use the `AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess`) and attaching it to your EC2 instance. One of the best practices when creating IAM policies is to grant least privilege to the users. The objective is to initially give the users only the access/permission they need to complete the intended task and grant additional permissions as necessary later. This is more secure than starting with permissions that are too lenient and then trying to tighten them later.

**Why using least privilege is important:**
Granting full access/excessive permissions might cause potential security breach if the account is compromised. The compromised account could execute malicious code or access sensitiveÂ data.
