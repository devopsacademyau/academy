Public IP:

I access the EC2 console and with help of documentation I made a configuration of my first instance. I create one Image of Amazon Linux AMI with a default VPC and I create a security group called Henrique Security Group to allows SSH with Key pairs that I create before named as myKey.

My terminal:

âœ¦ ðŸ‘½ henriquediniz ssh -i "myKey.pem" ec2-user@ec2-34-238-83-178.compute-1.amazonaws.com
Last login: Fri Feb  7 12:07:15 2020 from 155.143.178.112

Private IP: 

I create a Security Group to my Jump Server and I create a Jump Server instance with my SSH. After, I have uploaded my SSH with Putty to my instance that I would like to connect and tried to connect.




My terminal in putty:
