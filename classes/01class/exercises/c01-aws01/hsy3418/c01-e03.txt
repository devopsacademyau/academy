Create a new EC2 Instance inside the default VPC with an public IP address and connect to it though SSH

I follow the https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/getting-started/ to create a EC2 new instance

1. Login to the AWS console and find the EC2 service
2. Select Launch instance and follow the steps:
   - Step1: Choose an AMI: Amazon Linux 2 AMI  
   - Step2: Choose an instance type: t2.micro
   - Step3: Configure instance details: select default VPC network and select one subnet and enable auto-assign public IP
   - Step4: Leave other options as default and create a new SSH key pair and download the key
3. Wait for the instance to be running and run from my local machine
  $ ssh -i ~/downloads/ec2test.pem ec2-user@ec2-18-222-169-134.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com   
  but got an error the key file is too open, so change the permission
  $ chmod 400 ec2test.pem 
  and run the ssh command again, and receive the following response

22-169-134.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com

Create a new EC2 instance in the same VPC but with private address only and connect to it

Did some reading from https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html
A private IP means the instance is not reachable over the internet, but can still communicate with the instances 
within the same VPC.

Follow the same step as above but disable Auto-assign Public IP

After the instance up and running, run below from my local machine:
$ssh -i ~/downloads/ec2test.pem ec2-user@172.31.30.168
this can't be achieved cause 172.31.30.168 is a private address and can't be reached from outside of the VPC.

So attempt to conect to the new instance from the old instance, cause they are in the same VPC. For doing that,
I copied key file from my local to the old ec2 instance by running:
$scp -i ~/downloads/ec2test.pem ~/downloads/ec2test.pem ec2-user@ec2-18-222-169-134.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com:~/

Then SSH to that instance again, then run:
$ssh -i ~/downloads/ec2test.pem ec2-user@172.31.30.168

and receives following response:
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-39-31 ~]$ ssh -i ~/ec2test.pem ec2-user@172.31.30.168
The authenticity of host '172.31.30.168 (172.31.30.168)' can't be established.

Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
