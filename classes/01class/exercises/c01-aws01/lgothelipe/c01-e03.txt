Logged on my AWS account and launched a t2.micro instance under EC2 -> Instances.
Selected default values and downloaded a key pair at the end.
Converted the key .pem to .ppk using PuttyGen.
Connected to the instance's public DNS address using Putty.

Created a new EC2 t2.micro with Auto-assign Public IP option disabled using the same key as before.
Uploaded the key file .pem using WinSCP to the 1st EC2 (the one with public IP address).
Changed the permission of the key file (chmod 400)
SSH from the first instance to the 2nd using the command below:
 ssh -i devops.pem ec2-user@172.31.4.161
