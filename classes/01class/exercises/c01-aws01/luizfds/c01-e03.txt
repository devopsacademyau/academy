To achieve exercise 03 from class 01 I've accessed AWS Console using a non-root user and went to EC2 option to create 2 new instances inside the default VPC. For the first one, I've opted to create an Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 using the Free tier only option. In the 'Configure Instance' tab I've enabled the option to 'Auto-assign Public IP' for this first EC2 Instance (I left all other options as default), then I configured a Security Group named 'Luiz SG' with SSH protocol to open to network traffic on port 22. Before finish and create my instance I've named a Key pairs as 'Exercise: C01-E03' and downloaded it. The second instance was created almost in the same way but this time I've disabled the option 'Auto-assign Public IP' and using the same Security Group and key pair downloaded before.


To be able to connect to the first instance I've used PuTTY and on the Terminal screen from it I got those values:

Using username "ec2-user".
Authenticating with public key "imported-openssh-key"

Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.

I couldn't connect to the second instance straight way because it only have a private IP, so I used my first EC2 instance (that is siting in the same VPC) to connect to the second one, before to connect with it I need to upload my Key pairs to my first EC2 instance and I have used WinSCP to achieve that. And that is my Terminal output:

Using username "ec2-user".
Authenticating with public key "imported-openssh-key"
