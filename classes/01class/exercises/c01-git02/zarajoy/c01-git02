1. Is it possible to see the inner commit of squashed commit with `git rebase`?
```
yes - the git reflog command will show all actions within git (as long as the entries are not wiped / expired?) including commits squashed with a rebase.

git reflog

```

2. How to compare two different local repositories using `git diff`? How about remote ones, can you do the same?
```
git-diff commands shows changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

for comparing between two different local repos;
git diff [--no-index] <pathtobranch1> <pathtobranch2>

for comparing a remote repo;
git diff <remote>/<remote branch> <local branch>


```
