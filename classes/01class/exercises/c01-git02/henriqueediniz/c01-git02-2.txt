In order to compare two different local or remote repositories using git diff we can add the second repo as a remote to our current list of repos:
 $ git remote add other_name PATH_TO_OTHER_REPO

If the second repo is a remote one we can fetch it from that remote added before:
 $ git fetch other_name branch_name:branch_name

After doing that we can diff it with any of your branches, for example, to compare current branch against new branch(branch_name):
 $ git diff branch_name
