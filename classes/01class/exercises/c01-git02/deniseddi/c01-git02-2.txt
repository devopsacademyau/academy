2.How to compare two different local repositories using git diff? How about remote ones, can you do the same?

The "diff" command takes two inputs and compare the differences between them. My understanding is that these inputs can be files, branches, commits, etc. 

To compare two different local repos:
$ git diff branch1..branch2 or $ git diff <branch name a> <branch name b>

To compare to a remote repo:
$ git diff <local branch> <remote>/<remote branch>
