1. Is it possible to see the inner commit of squashed commit with git rebase?

No. As you are “squashing” commits and preparing to rebase, then yes you can see and choose the commits you want to squash (eg. “git rebase -i”). But after you “rebase”, you actually created new commits or re-wrote history, replacing the original and no longer reachable commits with a single one.
