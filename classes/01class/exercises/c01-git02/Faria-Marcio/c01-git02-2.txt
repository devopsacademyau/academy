How to compare two different local repositories using git diff? How about remote ones, can you do the same?
   To compare two different local repos using git diff we use the following command:
   $ git diff branch_1 branch_2

   It's possible to do the same for remote repositories, we just need to use the remote address of each repo as parameter:
   $ git diff origin/master upstream/master
