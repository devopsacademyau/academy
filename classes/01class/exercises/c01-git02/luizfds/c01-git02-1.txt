Is it possible to see the inner commit of squashed commit with git rebase?

Yes, it is possible. Squashed commits won't appear using a simple 'git log' command tough, to see inner commits of a squashed one we need to use the command 'git reflog' or 'git log --walk-reflogs'.

By default, git reflog will output the reflog of the HEAD ref. HEAD is a symbolic reference to the currently active branch. Reflogs are available for other refs as well. The syntax to access a git ref is name@{qualifier}. In addition to HEAD refs, other branches, tags, remotes, and the Git stash can be referenced as well.

You can get a complete reflog of all refs by executing:

 git reflog show --all
