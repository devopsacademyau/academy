# How to compare two different local repositories using git diff? How about remote ones, can you do the same?

In order to do that, we need to add the other repository using `git remote add` command following by `git diff` command.
Following the order to execute the comparison:

```
git remote add -f <name> <path/to/repo>
git diff master remotes/<name>/master
```

The `-f` flag on `git remote add` indicates that the git will fetch the remote changes.

The same procedure can be executed for remote repository. Just replaces `<path/to/repo>` to `<link/to/repo>`.

Once finished, the remote repository can be removed using the command `git remote rm <name>`.
