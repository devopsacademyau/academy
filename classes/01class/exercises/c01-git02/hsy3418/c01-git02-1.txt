Yes and no, 
Yes because git records logs of updates applied to tips of branches and other commit references, 
even when the commits are not referenced by any branches. command to see the logs: git reflog
No because if we squash commits using git rebase -i, it creates a new history by combining multiple 
commits into one new commit, so the old commits won't be shown in the history unless you want to check 
the logs of the updates you made by running git reflog.
