1. Add other local repo as a remote to my current repo

git remote add [other_repo_name] [other_repo_path]

2. fetch branch from remote

git fetch [other_repo_name] [branch_you_want_compare:rename_it_for_comparison_if_you_want]

3. Compare your current branch against the branch of the other repo with git diff 

git diff [branch_name_that_you_created]


Same applied to compare with remote branch by adding the remote from the git url


git remote add [other_repo_name] [git@github.com....]

other steps remain same
