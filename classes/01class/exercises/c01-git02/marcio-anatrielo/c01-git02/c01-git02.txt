You can add other repo first as a remote to your current repo:

$ git remote add other_name PATH_TO_OTHER_REPO

then fetch brach from that remote:

$ git fetch other_name branch_name:branch_name

this creates that branch as a new branch in your current repo, then you can diff that branch with any of your branches, for example, to compare current branch against new branch(branch_name):

$ git diff branch_name
