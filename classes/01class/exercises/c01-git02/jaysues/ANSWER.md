## Answers

1. Is it possible to see the inner commit of squashed commit with `git rebase`?
```
It is possible if you use a reflog command such as "git reflog "branch""
```

2. How to compare two different local branches using `git diff`? How about remote ones, can you do the same?
```
You can compare two different branches by placing them after git diff such as git diff "branch1" "branch2"
This also works on remote branches not just local.
```
