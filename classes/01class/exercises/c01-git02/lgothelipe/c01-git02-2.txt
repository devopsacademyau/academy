How to compare two different local repositories using git diff? How about remote ones, can you do the same?

To compare two different local repositories you can use the commands below:

#Add the 2nd local repository to the list of repos

	"git remote add 'repo_B' 'path_to_repo_b.git'"

#Compare the two repos with git diff 

	"git diff master remotes/repo_B/master"


The same applies to remote repositories:

#Add the 2nd repository to the list of repos

	"git remote add 'other-repo' 'git://....../remote-repo.git'"

#Compare the two repos with git diff

	"git diff master remotes/other-repo/master"
