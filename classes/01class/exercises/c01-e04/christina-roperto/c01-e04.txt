#S3(C01-E04) REVISED

* Created bucket called "c01-e04" and chose default options and uploaded README.md
* Went to IAM service and created a new policy with a limited list and read access as suggested. Called it "S3ListAndReadOnly"
* Created a new role and attached the "S3ListAndReadOnly" policy created on step 2 and called it "S3LeastPrivilege"
* Went back to list of EC2 instances created on the previous exercise (c01-e03) and chose the public one and attach IAM role "S3LeastPrivilege" created on the previous step
* connected to the EC2 instance and type aws s3 ls c01-e04
* copied the file from the S3 bucket using this line: aws s3 cp s3://c01-e04/README.md README.md
