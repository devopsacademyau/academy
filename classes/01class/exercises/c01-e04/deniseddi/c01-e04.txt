- Logged in to AWS console, created and named a S3 bucket "exercise04.week1" (bad name, will do better next time). 
- Uploaded a file (image) to bucket. "starwarsposter.jpg"
- Created IAM Role -> set permission -> attached "AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess" policy (keeping in mind the Principle of least priviledge for increased security). 
- Attached EC2 instance with Role: Ec2 Service on AWS console -> chose an instance previously created -> instance settings -> attach/Replace IAM Role -> applied role created. 
- On terminal, connected the EC2 (SSH). 
- EC2 access to S3 bucket with AWSCLI: 
- [ec2-user@ip-172-31-12-54 ~]$ aws s3 ls s3://exercise04.week1
