- I've created an S3 bucket on https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home?region=ap-southeast-2;
- Uploaded a test .txt file on it;
- Using least privileges I created a new IAM Policy allowing it to read and list S3 bucket only. JSON file:
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::c01e04",
                "arn:aws:s3:::c01e04/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
- Created an IAM role and attached the new policy to it;
- Associated the IAM role that I'd created to one of my instances;
- Connected to that instance;
- Used the command line "aws s3 ls"
