## Introduction

### Welcome and Program Induction

- Public repository for anyone that wishes to go through the exercises at your own pace
- DevOps academy is sharing and learning
- Help people get job ready for the cloud industry
- There is no competition and no single winners


### General guidelines

- The whole repository content is open-source and you can even sell it if you wish. (just remember that we can also use as we wish whatever you commit to it)
- Exercises answers from everyone will be easily accessible. Use it responsibly when you are stuck. If you copy/paste you will be wasting everyones time, but it is your call.
- There is a lot of content to go through. The in-person classes itself are just a reforcement of what is available on the repository. You will be required to spend quite a few hours by yourself.
- If you are motivated to get job ready after this course, we will help you!
- Soft skills are within the lines of this course. Helping others will demonstrate leadership and will help you thrive.

The DevopsAcademy is a working in progress and suggestions, contributions, reporting errors and/or bugs are more than welcome to help us make this content as best as possible for the community.


### Slack

Join our slack following instructions [here](/classes/00pre-class/README.md#join-slack)

- Our workspace consists in public channels (#general, #melbourne) and private ones for the in-person classes. Students will receive invites for the private channels.
- In-person classes question related should always be posted to the private channel
- Try not to discuss course related questions via direct message with other students. Instead, use the channels as your question/explanation might be the same from someone else.
