How did you achieve that?

1. Log in AWS account
2. Under EC2 - Load Balancers
3. Created Application Load Balancer with the details specified.

ALB:

Name: devops-lb01

IP address type: ipv4
Availability Zones: 
subnet-0d1afa6cd2fdcce30 - ap-southeast-2b

Access through your browser your load balancer CNAME record and keep refreshing the browser. 
What do you see?

Every refresh gets a different hostname from the 2 instances: 
ip-192.168.124.17.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal 
ip-192.168.144.220.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal
