- Create an Application Load Balancer with the following details and post.How did you achieve that?

on AWS console, I followed the steps to Create an Application Load Balancer:

1.Configured a Load Balancer and a Listener as per details given. 

2.Configured a Security Group
Assigned previously created security group for my ASG

3.Configured Routing(target group)
Name: target-group
Type: instance
Protocol: HTTP
Port 80  

4.Configure Targets for the Target Group
Registered targets. Selected the two previously created instances and added to registered on port 80.

5.Create the Load Balancer
Review -> create. 
Received message of successfully created load balancer “my-app-load-balancer”. After several minutes, state was active.

- Access through your browser your load balancer CNAME record and keep refreshing the browser. What do you see?

Copied DNS name (A Record) into the address field of web browser.
As I kept refreshing, the hostname changed (alternated) between the two instances. The load balancer takes requests from clients and distributes them across my two targets in the target group.
ip-10-0-3-92.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal <-> ip-10-0-1-77.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal

- Details of the security group used:

Security group name: sg_for_my_asg (same as for my ASG)
Security group ID: sg-0a4f7e086c889b942
VPC ID: vpc-017bb80047b1a21b3 (devopsacademy -vpc)
