- how did you achieve that?
    From EC2 > Load Balancers
    1. I Openned the Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
    2. In the navigation pane, I chose Load Balancers, Create Load Balancers.
    3. I selected `Application Load Balancer` as my load balancer type.
    4. Called it `devopsacademy-alb`.
    5. From Configure Security Settings panel:
        Name: 
        Scheme: internet-facing
        IP address type: ipv4
        Listeners: `HTTP > PORT 80`
        Security Group: auto-scaling-sg
        VPC: devopsacademy-vpc
        Availability Zones: public-a, public-b
        Target group:
            Name:
            Target type: Instance
            Protocol: HTTP
            Port: 80
        Register Targets: My instances created by my ASG in previous exercise.
    6. I chose Create.

- access through your browser your load balancer CNAME record and keep refreshing the browser. What do you see?
    My index page created in previous exercise with my instance metadata (from one of my 2 instances) and everytime I refreshed the page I got a response from a different instance.
