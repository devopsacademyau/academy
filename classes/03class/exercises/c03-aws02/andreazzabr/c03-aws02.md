- how did you achieve that?
aws console
ec2
load balancers
creat lb
name: devops-elb
internet-facing
ipv4
vpc: devopsacademy-vpc
subnets: public-a / public-b / public-c
security groups:  selected my custom: public-sg
registered targets: 2 instantes from my ASG


- access through your browser your load balancer CNAME record and keep refreshing the browser. What do you see?
when i access http://devops-elb-2046119096.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com
it points to my 2 instances randomly, showing the instance hostname on index file
http://ec2-13-239-10-138.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ :   ip-10-0-181-143.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal
http://ec2-3-106-114-160.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com/ :   ip-10-0-103-132.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal
