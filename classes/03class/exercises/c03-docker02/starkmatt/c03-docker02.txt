Changing the file on container 2 (exercise02:v2)
Was instant!
After going back to the browser and hitting refresh the page was instantly updated on 8082 !

I ran into issues building the container initally, working with Kiko found out it was a windows bug.
Needed to run this following article https://github.com/docker-library/docs/pull/669/files

Running the docker container after the build process with -dp parameter 

After both containers were running, I ran the following command to enter container #2 
 docker exec -it c70becb854b2 /bin/sh and the shell opened, after I then navigated to htdocs folder in /usr/ and changed the index.html HTML code hit refresh 
 and it showed the changes
