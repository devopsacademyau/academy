# C03-Docker02

## Docker 
- [Dockerfile.v1](Dockerfile.v1)
- [Dockerfile.v2](Dockerfile.v2)

## Command Execution Output
- Curl command and its output of before changing the image:
    ```
    $ curl localhost:8081
    <h1>DevOps Academy - Docker - Exercise c03-docker02</h1>

    $ curl localhost:8082
    <h1>DevOps Academy - Docker - Exercise c03-docker02</h1>
    ```

- Curl command and its output of after changing the image:
    ```
    $ curl localhost:8081
    <h1>DevOps Academy - Docker - Exercise c03-docker02</h1>

    $ curl localhost:8082
    <h1>DevOps Academy - Docker - Exercise c03-docker02</h1>

    <code>
        insert your big change here ðŸ˜†
    </code>
    ```

- Explain any difference between the responses of the webservers before and after changing the file locally:
    ```
    The main difference is that I can modify the index.html file locally, and those changes will be shown on image v2.
    
    The first image (v1) is built with a copy of the `index.html` file at the building time.
    Whereas, the second image (v2) does not have the `index.html` at building time, but it is mounted at running time.
    
    Also, if I use the same docker run command with mount volume arguments on the image v1, I can replace the index.html file copied at building time.
    ```
