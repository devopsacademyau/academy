Finally to run the docker  container while mapping the port of localhost 8081 to container port 80
```
docker run -dp 8081:80 exercise02:v1
```
Similarly run the docker  container while mapping the port of localhost 8082 to container port 80

```
docker run -dp 8082:80 -v ~/Documents/academy/classes/03class/exercises/c03-docker02/mayuthombre:/usr/local/apache2/htdocs exercise02:v2 
```

- Curl command and its output of after changing the image:
```
curl Localhost:8081                                                                                                                         
<h1>DevOps Academy - Docker - Exercise c03-docker02</h1>
curl Localhost:8082
<h1>DevOps Academy - Docker - Exercise c03-docker02 test</h1>
```

- Explain any difference between the responses of the webservers before and after changing the file locally:
```
 In the first image "exercise02:v1" there is a copy of the index.html file inside the container volume and that's why the webserver's response does not change even though we have made changes to index.html on host machine
 Because webserver is poiniting to the copy of index.html on container volume where there are no changes.
 
 In constrast, with the second image has access to host folder using (-v flag). When you use this, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. Therfore, any changes made on the index.html (within host machine) are visible immediately after a page refresh (http://localhost:8082).
```
