<p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

Explain any difference between the responses of the webservers before and after changing the file locally.
    host_folder = `classes/03class/docker/artifacts/c03-docker02`
    container_folder = `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/`

    The first webserver `http://localhost:8081/` has a copy of the index.html file inside the folder container_folder and that's why the webserver's response was the same even when I changed the index.hml file from host_folder. In constrast, the second webserver has direct access to host_folder using bind mount (-v flag). When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container. The file or directory is referenced by its full or relative path on the host machine. 

    #Running a docker container using bind mount flag.
