# Webservers (c03-docker02)

Create two docker images, being: 
- Named `exercise02` with a tag `v1` with the following pre-requisites:
    - Dockerfile must be named Dockerfile.v1
    - Final image is based from httpd:2.4.41-alpine
    - Copy the file classes/03class/docker/artifacts/c03-docker02/index.html into the folder /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
- Named `exercise02` with a tag `v2` with the following pre-requisites
    - Dockerfile must be named Dockerfile.v2
    - Final image is based from httpd:2.4.41-alpine
    - The folder /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/ must be empty

Run a container using the exercise02:v1 image exposing the container port(80) to yout localhost port 8081. You should be able to access the webserver throught http://localhost8081

Run a second container using the exercise02:v2 image exposing the container port(80) to your localhost port 8082. Additionaly, map the folder `classes/03class/docker/artifacts/c03-docker02/` of this repo into the folder `/usr/local/apache2/htdocs/` of the container during it's execution. You should be able to access the webserver throught http://localhost8082

You should have a similar behaviour when accessing both containers. You can use the command `curl http://localhost:8081` and `curl http://localhost:8082` to access the page being served by the containers.

Now change the content of the file classes/03class/docker/artifacts/c03-docker02/index.html, and without stoping the running containers, check if anything changed when accessing both URLs again.

## Submit a PR with the following files:
- Dockerfile.v1: used to create the first image
- Dockerfile.v2: used to create the second image
- c03-docker02.txt: Containing the output of the curl commands executed before and after changing the file indicated. Explain any difference between the responses of the webservers before and after changing the file locally.
