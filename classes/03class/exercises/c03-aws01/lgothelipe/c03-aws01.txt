Create an Auto Scaling Group with the following details and post:

How did you achieve that?

1.Logged into my AWS account
2.Created a Launch Configuration under EC2 -> Launch Configuration
3.Selected Amazon Linux 2 AMI, t2.micro (Free Tier) and created a security group allowing port 80 from anywhere, name devops-lc01.
4.Created a Auto Scaling Group (devops-asg01) with the Launch Configuration created before.
5.Got an error on ASG creation "One or more security groups in the launch configuration are not linked to the VPCs configured in the Auto Scaling group"
6.Recreated the Launch Configuration with SGs associated to the DevOps VPC and created the ASG.

ASG details:

Launch Configuration devops-lc01
Availability Zone(s) ap-southeast-2b, ap-southeast-2a
Subnet(s) subnet-0d1afa6cd2fdcce30,subnet-0f3870b2f15dc1ac7
Desired Capacity 2
Min 1
Max 2

Access through your browser each instance IP on port 80 http://<instance-ip> and post the hostname of each one:

Instance #1: ip-172-16-40-17.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal
Instance #2: ip-172-16-20-202.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal



Details of the security group used:

Group name AutoScaling-Security-Group-1
Group description AutoScaling-Security-Group-1 (2020-03-05 19:45:45.449+11:00)
Group ID sg-03efbac7a600755eb
VPC ID vpc-06ce419efb39da1e3

Inbound rule:

Type HTTP | Protocol TCP | Port Range 80 | Source 0.0.0.0/0



What this line is doing? curl https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html

This line is geting the hostname of the EC2 instance and writing on the file index.html
After that, the script moves the file to the http service folder that can be accessed by a brower using the EC2 public IP.

Instance metadata (https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data) is data about the instance that can be used to configure or manage the running instance. The user data specified when launching an instance can be accessed from http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data.
