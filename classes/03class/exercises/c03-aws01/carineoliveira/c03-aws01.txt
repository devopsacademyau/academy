Class 03 - Exercise AWS 01

Create an Auto Scaling Group with the following details and post:

- how did you achieve that?

Under EC2 -> Launch templates

    I first created a Launch template with the following details:

        Name: instance-template   
        AMI: Amazon Linux AMI 2 (HVM), SSD Volume Type
        Type: t2.nano
        Key Pair: used the existing one 'academy-key-pair.pem'
        Security group: I created a group with a inboud rule to allow anywhere access to port 80
        Advanced:
            User-data:
                #! /bin/bash
                yum update -y
                yum install -y httpd
                curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html
                mv index.html /var/www/html/
                systemctl start httpd

                
    From the created template (or Under EC2 -> Auto Scaling Groups -> Launch Template), I created a Auto Scaling Group with the following details:

        Group Name: aws01-asg
        VPC: devopsacademy-vpc
        Subnet: I selected two public subnets

    Edit the created scaling group and add update:
        Desired Capacity: 2
        Min: 1
        Max: 2
        
The instances will automatically be created. 


- access through your browser each instance IP on port 80 http://<instance-ip> and post the hostname of each one

    Instance 1: 
        IP: http://3.24.180.249/
        Hostname: ip-172-31-41-131.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal

    Instance 2: 
        IP: http://13.211.239.40/
        Hostname: ip-172-31-14-130.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal


- details of the security group used

    Security group name: aws01-sg
    Security group ID: sg-051891e06cdf27fc1
    Description: sg to aws01 exercise

    Owner: 160372566358
    Inbound rules count: 2 Permission entries
        Type    Protocol    Port range      Source      Description - optional
        HTTP	TCP	        80	            0.0.0.0/0	-
        HTTP	TCP	        80	            ::/0	    -
    Outbound rules count: 1 Permission entry
        Type            Protocol    Port range      Source      Description - optional
        All Traffic	    All	        All	            0.0.0.0/0	-

- what this line is doing? curl https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html
    It is retriving the metadata from the running instance and transfering it to a index file.
