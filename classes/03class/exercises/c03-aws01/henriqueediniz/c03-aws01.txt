* how did you achieve that?
    
    1. Open Amazon EC2 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/.
    
    2. Create Launch Templates, Create launch template.
    
    3. Put name as `devopsacademy-launch-template` and gave it a brief description of the launch template version.
    
    4. For Launch template contents, I provided the following information:
        AMI ID: Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM), SSD Volume Type
        Instance type: t2.micro (Free tier)
        Key pair name: Selected one of the last class
        Networking platform: Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
        Security groups: auto-scaling-sg (Created with a rule to allow inbound connections from anywhere on port 80)
        Storage (volumes): default
        Instance tags: `Name: devopsacademy-asg`
        Advanced details/User data: 
            ```#! /bin/bash
            yum update -y
            yum install -y httpd
            curl 192.168.124.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html
            mv index.html /var/www/html/
            systemctl start httpd```
    5. I chose Create launch template, then I selected it and from `Actions` I clicked on `Create Auto Scaling Group`.
    6. From Create Auto Scaling Group panel, I provided the following information:
        Group name: devopsacademy-asg
        Launch Template: lt-0cd7e9f3f1479ae34
        Launch Template Version: default
        Fleet Composition: Adhere to the launch template
        Network:
            VPC: devopsacademy-vpc
            Subnets: public-a, public-b
        Health checks:
            Health check type: EC2
            Health check grace period: 300 seconds
        Group size (Minimum/Maximum/Desired): `1/2/2`

        
* details of the security group:
    Group name: auto-scaling-sg
    Group description: auto-scaling-sg
    Group ID: sg-0d21d8d287374acb4v
    VPC ID: vpc-01ca526eeg23wqrc0
   
    Inbound: 
        Type: HTTP
        Protocol: TCP
        Port Range: 80
        Source: Anywhere

- what this line is doing? `curl https://192.168.124.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html`
  It's creating a new file called `index.html` and writing on it my instance metadata retrieved from the IP address `https://192.168.124.254/latest/meta-data/hostname`, btw this IP is a link-local address and is valid only from the instance.
