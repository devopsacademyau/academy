Create an Auto Scaling Group with the following details and post

QUESTIONS:

   - How did you achieve that?
	AWS Console --> EC2 --> Auto Scaling --> Auto Scaling Groups --> Create Auto Scaling Group --> Get Started --> Amazon Linux 2 --> t2.micro --> 
			Name: devopsacademy-asg-launch; 
			User data:
				#! /bin/bash
				yum update -y
				yum install -y httpd
				curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html
				mv index.html /var/www/html/
				systemctl start httpd
			IP Address Type: Assign a public IP address to every instance
	Ps. I had to create a new security group (devopsacademy-sg-asg) with inbound rule for port 80 on VPC -> Security Group Menu and use it on Create Auto Scaling Group because my default VPC isn't devopsacademy-vpc one.

	--> Create Auto Scaling Group
		Group name: devopsacademy-asg
		Group size: 2
		Network: devopsacademy-vpc
		Subnet: public-a, public-b
	--> Configure Scalling Police
		Use scaling policies to adjust the capacity of this group
		Scale between 1 and 2 instances
		Desired: 2
		Scale Group Size: devopsacademy-sgs
	--> Create Auto Sacling group



   - Access through your browser each instance IP on port 80 http://<instance-ip> and post the hostname of each one
	- http://52.64.11.209:80
	    ip-192-168-102-83.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal
	- http://52.63.182.63:80
	    ip-192-168-101-151.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal


   - Details of the security group used
	Name	Group ID		Group Name		VPC ID			Type	Description			Owner
		sg-0f0a8b39374d935a7	devopsacademy-sg-asg	vpc-04386a3405acb18af	EC2-VPC	AutoScaling-Security-Group	148446344264


   - What this line is doing? curl https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html
	curl is a command line tool to transfer data to or from a server, using any of the supported protocols (HTTP, FTP, IMAP, POP3, SCP, SFTP, SMTP, TFTP, TELNET, LDAP or FILE), so in this case it is creating "index.html/' file with metadata from the IP address.
