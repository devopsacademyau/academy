- how did you achieve that?

Step 1: Create a new SG that allow connection from anywhere to port 80

4. Configure security group just created for allowing connection from anywhere to port 80
5. Create with an existing keypair  

Step 3: Create an auto scalling group
1. Select an auto scalling group
2. name: aca_asg
3. Launch configuration: aca_launch_config
5. Group size :1
4. select the VPC and two subnets: public-a, public-b
5. Health check period: 300 seconds
6. Configure scalling options:  
   a. Scale between 1 and 2 instances
   b. metric type: average CPU utilization
   c. Target value : 2
7. Leave other options as what they are and confirm creation   

- access through your browser each instance IP on port 80 http://<instance-ip> and post the hostname of each one
1. htttp://13.211.109.67 -> ip-10-0-4-46.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal
2.  htttp://http://3.24.178.184 -> ip-10-0-2-4.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal

- what this line is doing? curl https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html
Retrieving the instance hostname and write it into a index.html, that's why we can see the hostname when access the instance
The IP address 169.254.169.254 is a link-local address and is valid only from the instance.
http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ is used to retrieve different metadata of the instance.
