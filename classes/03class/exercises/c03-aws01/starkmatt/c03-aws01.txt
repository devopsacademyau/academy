##### Exercise 1 / c01-aws01

- Open EC2 Console
- Choose Launch Templates, Create launch template.
- Gave it a name of devopsacademy-launchconfig
- Select Amazon Linux Image 2, t2.Nano instance, KeyPair (Used Original one created), used devopsacademy-vpc, devops-asg80 Security Group, Select "Assign Public IP address to every instance" (I ran into issues with this before as Only assign a public IP address to default VPC instances was checked)
the following entry in Advanced / User-Data

#! /bin/bash
yum update -y
yum install -y httpd
curl 169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html
mv index.html /var/www/html/
systemctl start httpd

- Created a new Security group named "devops-asg80" 
Inbound Rule:
Type HTTP / Protocol TCP / Port Range 80 / Source 0.0.0.0/0


- Created AutoScaling group using launch template above
called it devopsa-asg01, with my two public subnets created before public-a / public-b (AZ Southeast A/B)
Scaling group size 1 / 2 / 2 and balanced with Average CPU Utilization (60%)
Finished,

Went into Instance and checked on the VM's being created, once green tick's appeared I then navigated to both instances via Web browser

Instance #1: 13.211.47.220
Instance #2  13.236.84.131

what this line is doing? curl https://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/hostname > index.html

Looks like thsi line is calling the metadata of the EC2 Instance and writing it to the index.html.
The user data then after moves it to /var/www/html and places the file in there so when you navigate to the IP address via the browser it'll
the curl command results in the html document.

I had some issues with port 80 as the Linix image I used for the build was an older AMI and didn't support systemctl.
After changing the instance to AMI 2 the build worked with no issues!
