A brief explanation of what happened when you executed the commands to run the containers
Docker first tried to find the image locally and as I don't have any image on local computer Docker tried to find it on Docker Hub. With the image located on Hub, Docker pulled it to local machine and then ran it.

Something happened with the second image (the with using Bind mount) and it didn't started straight away but it worked when I executed the run command again.
