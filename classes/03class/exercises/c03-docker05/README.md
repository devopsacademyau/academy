# Running Again (c03-docker05)

Now that there is nothing related to the images built during exercise 2 on your local, we'll both containers again, with the exactly the same parameters/configurations, however, the images that we'll use will be the ones hosted on DockerHub, so when executing the container, it should use the image with a name similar to `yourdockerhubuser/exercise02:v1` and `yourdockerhubuser/exercise02:v2`. You won't need to create the image as you did on the exercise02. 

## Submit a PR with the following files:
- c03-docker05-01.txt: Containing the commands executed to run both containers.
- c03-docker05-02.txt: A brief explanation of what happened when you executed the comands to run the containers
- c03-docker05-03.txt: Containing the command to list all images on your local as well as it's output.
