# Running Again (c03-docker05)

Now that there is nothing related to the images built during exercise 2 on your local, we'll both containers again, with the exactly the same parameters/configurations, however, the images that we'll use will be the ones hosted on DockerHub, so when executing the container, it should use the image with a name similar to `yourdockerhubuser/exercise02:v1` and `yourdockerhubuser/exercise02:v2`. You won't need to create the image as you did on the exercise02.
