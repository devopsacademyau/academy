- how did you achieve that?
    I opted to use public hosted zone for this exercise.
        1. From AWS Management Console I openned the Route 53 console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/route53/
            1.1 I resgistered a domain called `luizsilva.com` (I am going to use in a personal website in a new future)
            1.2 By doing step one, AWS automatically created a Public Hosted Zone for my new domain.
            1.3 I openned my hosted zone and created a new Record Set with following configuration:
                Name: luizsilva.com.
                Type: A - IPv4 address
                Alias: Yes
                    Alias Target: dualstack.devopsacademy-alb-1916322731.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com. (Load Balancer DNS)
            1.4 I also added a `www` subdomain for my new domain. I accomplished that by adding a new Record Set with following configuration:
                Name: www .luizsilva.com.
                Type: CNAME
                Alias: No
                    Value: devopsacademy-alb-1916322731.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com
        2. With my domain available, I openned the ACM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home in order to issue a SSL Certificate
            Domain	Validation status
            luizsilva.com	Success
            *.luizsilva.com	Success
        3. With SSL working properly, I accessed my Load Balancer again and added another Listener for HTTPS : 443
        4. Then I edited my Listener for HTTP a now all HTTP resquests are being redirected to my HTTPS.
            Redirect to https://#{host}:443/#{path}?#{query}
            Status code:HTTP_301
