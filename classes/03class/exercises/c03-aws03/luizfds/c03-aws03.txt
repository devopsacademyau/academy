### OPTIONAL - Create a private or public hosted zone and post:

- how did you achieve that?
- create a friendly CNAME record to your load balancer A record
- if you decide to go with public zone, you will have to own a domain (free domains at http://www.dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en)
- if you decide to go with private zone, you will need to test the friendly record from an instance running on your VPC.

Post here any findings, how option you decided to go with, records created, domain created, and anything else that you find interesting.
