Class 03 - Exercise AWS 03

Create a private or public hosted zone and post:

- how did you achieve that?

    I have searched for Route 53 on the Services menu, selected Hosted zones and pressed Create Hosted Zone with the following details:
        Domain Name: carine 
        Type: Private Hosted Zone for Amazon VPC
        VPC ID: selected the VPC used in the previous exercise


- create a friendly CNAME record to your load balancer A record

    After creating the hosted zone, I have additionally created a Record Set where I provided the following details:
        Name: carine
        Type: A - IPv4 address 
        Alias: Yes
        Alias Target: selected the load balancer created on the previous exercise
        Routing Policy: Simple


- if you decide to go with public zone, you will have to own a domain (free domains at http://www.dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en)
    
    Not applicable

- if you decide to go with private zone, you will need to test the friendly record from an instance running on your VPC.

- Post here any findings, how option you decided to go with, records created, domain created, and anything else that you find interesting.
    
    I have got the error message “502 Bad Gateway” when executing the command curl http://academy.carine. from my instance. 
    I also noticed that my target group was displaying an unhealthy status and I believe is was because of the same check failed code [502].
    To solve the issue I had to add an outbound rule for ports 80 / 443 on the security group that I used on the instance
