Exercise 03 - Create a private or public hosted zone.

•	How did you achieve that? 

1. Created a private hosted zone because it wasn’t possible to create a free domain through http://www.dot.tk/en/index.html?lang=en
website. Anything I typed and clicked “get it now!” soon turned to unavailable

On AWS console: 

Service Route 53 -> DNS Management -> Get Started Now -> Create hosted Zone
Domain name: abracadabra.
Type: Private Hosted Zone for Amazon VPC
VPC ID: vpc-017bb80047b1a21b3 | ap-southeast-2 (devopsacademy-vpc)
-> Create

•	Create a friendly CNAME record to your load balancer A record

2. Created a new record type A "my-alias.abracadabra."

Creating an alias 
Route 53 -> Go to Record Sets (after selecting my private hosted zone) -> Create record set 
Name: my-alias
Type A – Ipv4
Alias: yes
Alias target: ELB application load balancer “dualstack.my-app-load-balancer-1469952236.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com”
->Create

3. Tested the new friendly name from within a running instance on my AWS infrastructure using "curl http://<your-url>".
