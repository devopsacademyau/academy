    * Using UPSERT because it is practical and I may need to update it anyway

- Post any findings, how option you decided to go with, records created, domain created, and anything else that you find interesting.

    - I was going to do the public hosted zone, but it took a while until I receive the e-mail for the free domain registration. Then, I started the private, make it works, got excited, received a verification e-mail, did the public zone as well ðŸ˜…
    - AWS will set the hosted zone to private when VPC is specified, even if you set PrivateZone=False. I needed to recreate the route a couple of times until I release that. The CLI didn't give any warning. ðŸ˜¢
    - I found the docs to update the recordset not as clear as the other docs. I could not find exactly how I should create the A record to link to the ALB. I ended up creating it on the console and listed the resources to check how it was created.
    - I would expect some small delay until the route 53 propagate the changes, but as soon as I set it, I was able to connect to my private hosted zone. Impressive ðŸ‘ŒðŸ‘Œ.
    - Overall, I found it quite easy to set up a private hosted zone. When I started, I thought that I would need to execute a thousand commands.
    - Forgot to set the key pair to my instances so I needed to recreate the launch configuration, ASG and update the LB register again. ðŸ™„ *I am getting good in recreating things ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£*
    - I cannot set CNAME record with AliasTarget; the connection will be refused. But it works as expected for the standard way with TTL and string value to DNS alias.
    - There is a helpful tool to test the zone registry: `aws route53 test-dns-answer`
