- Post any findings, how option you decided to go with, records created, domain created, and anything else that you find interesting.

Alan Lima helped me to update the domain NameServer using the aws one, so now is working all good.

To update the NameServers I had to login into the domain .tk website and add the aws name servers that were generated by `create-hosted-zone` command.

After that to reflect the changes into my Loadbalancer took quite a while, not sure if was cache into my machine, but took around 10 minutes to make it work, and apparently outside of my network it was working after couple of seconds. 

curl cname.guiepifanio.tk
ip-10-0-222-25.ap-southeast-2.compute.internal%
