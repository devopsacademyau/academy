#Create a private or public hosted zone and post:

   --> On AWS console --> Services --> Route 53 --> Hosted Zones --> Create Hosted Zone:
	Domain Name: faria.
	Type: Private Hosted Zone for Amazon VPC
	Associated VPC: devopsacademy-.. | vpc-04386a3405acb18af | ap-southeast-2

   --> On Hosted Zone --> Selected faria --> Go to Record Set --> Create Record Set:
	Name: intra.faria
	Type: A - IPv4 address
	Alias: Yes
	Alias Target: dualstack.internal-alb-faria-197225106.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com.



#Post here any findings, how option you decided to go with, records created, domain created, and anything else that you find interesting:

   - As I had deleted my NAT gateways, Load Balancers, and Auto Scalling Groups, I needed to recreate them and well as reconfigure my Route Table to use the new NGW.
   - The trickest part was to find out that I needed to enable DNS hostnames in my VPC. It took my a while to realize that.



#Result:

   --> I connected in my public EC2 instance and through it I accessed the private route53 hostname for my private instances:
