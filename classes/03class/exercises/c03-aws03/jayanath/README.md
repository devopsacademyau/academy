- Post any findings, how option you decided to go with, records created, domain created, and anything else that you find interesting.
```
I used my own test domain, jayforweb.com for this task. I had to update the name servers on the domain provider as usual.
There were few challenges when doing this using AWS CLI.

1 - Needed to provide a --caller-reference for creating hosted zone. This value should be unique and the same value does not work
even if we delete the hosted zone and try again.

2 - Received below error and spent some time to figure out what is wrong.
    An error occurred (InvalidChangeBatch) when calling the ChangeResourceRecordSets operation: [Tried to create an alias that targets doa-alb-1952384790.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com., type A in zone Z0495682VQJK7N9GFOQI, but the alias target name does not lie within the target zone, Tried to create an alias that targets doa-alb-1952384790.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com., type A in zone Z0495682VQJK7N9GFOQI, but that target was not found]
I was using the hosted zone ID that I created for the hosted zone ID field of the Alias target. Then I had to use the console to figure out the hosted zone ID for the ELB DNS record. I could not find an easy way to retrieve that info using AWS CLI.

3 - Received the following error.
    An error occurred (InvalidChangeBatch) when calling the ChangeResourceRecordSets operation: [RRSet with DNS name doa. is not permitted in zone jayforweb.com.]
This was because I was using just doa, instead of fully qualified name.

4 - Could not create a CNAME as an ALIAS for the ELB DNS record. I had to create an A record instead. I tried to create a CNAME using console but the drop down does not provide ELB as a possible target.
