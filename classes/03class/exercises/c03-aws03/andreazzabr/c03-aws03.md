### OPTIONAL - Create a private or public hosted zone and post:

- how did you achieve that?
aws console
route53 - hosted zones
create hosted zone
    domain name: devopsandreazza.com
    type: private
    vpc-id: vpc-091e2e7dedd9eece2 | ap-southeast-2


- create a friendly CNAME record to your load balancer A record
create record set
    name: myelb
    type: cname
    alias: devops-elb-2046119096.ap-southeast-2.elb.amazonaws.com



- if you decide to go with private zone, you will need to test the friendly record from an instance running on your VPC.
