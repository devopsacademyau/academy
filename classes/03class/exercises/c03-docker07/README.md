# ECS (c03-docker07)
For this exercise we're going to play with ECS and create a Cluster, a Service, and a Task definition. Then we'll access the container through the internet.
This exercise will cost some money, so it is OPTIONAL. If you don't want to spend any money, don't do it.

You'll follow this [AWS tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/deploy-docker-containers/) to deploy the resources. During the container definition, insert the image `kikobr82/da-example`, instead of the one specified in the tutorial. All other steps should be the same.


## Submit a PR with the following files:
- c03-docker07: Containing the execution of the `curl` command accessing the website and it's output. Use only TEXT for the command output, don't include images (JPEG, PNG, etc)
