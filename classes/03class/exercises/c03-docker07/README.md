# ECS (c03-docker07)
Fir this exercise we're going to play with ECS and will create a Cluster, a Service and a Task definition and we'll access the container through the internet.
This exercise will cost some money, so if you don;t want to spend any money here, don;t do it.

You'll follow this [AWS tutorial](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tutorials/deploy-docker-containers/) to deploy the resources. During the Task definition, insert the image `kikobr82/da-example`, instead of the one specified in the tutorial. All other steps should be the same.


## Submit a PR with the following files:
- c03-docker07: Containing the execution of the `curl` command accessing the website and it's output. Use only TEXT for the command output, don't include images (JPEG, PNG, etc)
