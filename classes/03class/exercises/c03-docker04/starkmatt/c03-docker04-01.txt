###Exercise 4.1 - Docker 

First I ran docker images to show the list of containers.
Then I noticed that the containers that I had uploaded had duplicated.
So I've stopped the containers by using 

docker container stop -t 5 (Using the Image ID's)

docker prune (removed all stopped containers)

And then deleted the images using
docker image rm -f <INSTANCE ID>  (I did it this way as I have a few personal docker containers)
