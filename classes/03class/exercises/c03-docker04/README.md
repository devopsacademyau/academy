# Clean Up (c03-docker04)

Now that both images were successfully stored at DockerHub, you need to clean up everything related to previous exercises. Make sure there is no image stored on your local, no container running and no exited container on your local.

## Submit a PR with the following files:
- c03-docker04-01.txt: Containing the commands executed to clean up both the images and the containers(running or exited) from your local. 
- c03-docker04-02: Containing the command and it's output showing that there is no image or container on your local. Use only TEXT for the command output, don't include images (JPEG, PNG, etc)
