## Command Explanations

```text
3M patterns allows developers to use any tool they want and however version fancy them.
Developers don't need to worry anymore about installing and configuring tools in your local machine or hours of headache with version incompatibility.
Do you like to test a brand-new really cool feature that it is in preview and you don't want to mess up with your environment? Just docker it up and run in the container.

Both commands will use an image which has awscli and make cli installed so we only need to pass is the AWS authentication variables.
Since that we wrap all the code inside bash scripts, we can just run the container with the volume mounted to our app directory and call the script inside the container. Temporary files can be created inside the container and it will all be deleted when the container is removed.
