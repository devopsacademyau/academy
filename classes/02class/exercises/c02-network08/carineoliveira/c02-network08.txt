Class 02 - Exercise Network 08

Look for the network ACL created for your VPC and answer the following:
Your ACL rule inbound and outbound should look like this:

Rule#	Type	        Protocol	Port Range	Source	        Allow/Deny
100	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        <vpc-network>	ALLOW
101	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        0.0.0.0/0	    ALLOW
*	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        0.0.0.0/0	    DENY

- What is the difference between inbound x outbound?
    Inbound: allows traffic from a single IP address to access the instance.
        It controls connections coming into a subnet and it is used to allow or deny an IP address or a network range. 
            e.g. single IP address (192.168.1.1/32) | network range (192.168.1.0/24)
        
    Outbound: allows all traffic to leave the instance.
        It controls connections leaving a subnet, as inbound rules, it can allow or deny an IP address or a network range to leave the subnet.

- What is going to happen by default? Everything allowed or denied?
    Everything allowed.

- How would you block SSH connection comming from the network 172.16.200.0/24?

Rule#	Type	        Protocol	Port Range	Source	            Allow/Deny
100	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        <vpc-network>	    ALLOW
90	    SSH (22)	    TCP (6)	    22	        172.16.200.0/24	    DENY
*	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        0.0.0.0/0	        DENY

- How would you block access from your network to an external network 180.200.50.0/24?

Rule#	Type	        Protocol	Port Range	Source	            Allow/Deny
100	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        <vpc-network>	    ALLOW
90	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        180.200.50.0/24	    DENY
*	    ALL Traffic	    ALL	        ALL	        0.0.0.0/0	        DENY
