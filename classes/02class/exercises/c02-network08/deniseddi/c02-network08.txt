Network ACL (NACL's)

•	What is the difference between inbound x outbound?
    Both have to do with the direction of traffic. 
    Inbound: traffic initiate from external.
    Outbound: traffic initiate from internal.
    Therefore, inbound rules filter traffic passing (in) to the subnet and outbound rules filter traffic passing (out) from the subnet to the network. 

•	What is going to happen by default? Everything allowed or denied?
    According to the AWS docs, the default network ACL is configured to allow all traffic to flow in and out of the subnets. So, everything allowed. 

•	How would you block SSH connection coming from the network 172.16.200.200/24?
    Apparently, the only way to deny sources/IP addresses is to use Network ACL's in the VPC. So, after logging in to AWS console, I would go to my VPC dashboard and then to Network ACLs. I can then open the ACL editor, select the subnet where I would have my instance running, Edit the inbound rules by adding a new rule and explicitly “deny” the IP address 172.16.200.200/24 specifying a rule number less than 100, in order to be evaluated before the default. The standard TCP port for SSH is 22. Save it. 

•	How would you block access from your network to an external network 180.200.50.0/24?
    I would go to my VPC dashboard and then to Network ACLs. I would then open the ACL editor, select the subnet, this time select the Outbound rules -> Edit it by adding a new rule and explicitly “deny” the IP address 180.200.50.0/24 giving it a rule number less than 100. Selecting Type: "All Traffic", Protocol “All” (Any) and Port “All”.  Save it.
