Network ACL (NACL's)
Look for the network ACL created for your VPC and answer the following:
Your ACL rule inbound and outbound should look like this:

Rule#    Type    Protocol    Port Range    Source    Allow/Deny
100    ALL Traffic    ALL    ALL    <vpc-network>    ALLOW
101    ALL Traffic    ALL    ALL    0.0.0.0/0    ALLOW
*    ALL Traffic    ALL    ALL    0.0.0.0/0    DENY

What is the difference between inbound x outbound?
Inbound rules filters connections TO the subnet and outbound is FROM the subnet

What is going to happen by default? Everything allowed or denied?
All allowed
