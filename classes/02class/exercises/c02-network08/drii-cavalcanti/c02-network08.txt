1. What is the difference between inbound x outbound?
   The difference between inboud(ingress) and outbound(egress) is the direction of the traffic based on the point-of-view of the subnets interface. In other words, inbound is the traffic that an network receives and outbound is the traffic that an network sends.

   As ACL rules are read in ascending order, network ACL allows all inbound and outbound traffic due to rule #101
