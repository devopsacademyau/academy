##Exercise 9
- VPC Dasboard, on the left hand side select 'Security Groups'
Had a group already created for Public Network when I initally created my EC2 Instances.
But created two new ones as per exercise requirements.

- Clicked Create security group, added the name public-sq attached it to the VPC and added the description mentioned above.
I then clicked Inbound Rules on the Security Group and added SSH from my home IP Address.

- For the private-sg, I used the same methodology as above but with the diffence was giving SSH access only from my public subnet

Inbound

SSH	TCP	22	sg-07b8771632e783233 (public.sg)	SSH from Public Subnet

Outbound:

All traffic	All	All	0.0.0.0/0	-
