To achieve this task, first I followed the steps from AWS docs on creating a Security Group:

1. On VPC dashboard, selected Security Groups -> Create Security group.
2. Entered the following details:
   Security group name: public-sg, Description: SSH access from home to AWS, VPC: devopsacademy-vpc
3. Create. 

To add Rules:
4. Selected the security group just created. On the top of navigation pane, selected Actions -> Edit inbound rules -> Add Rule
   Type: Custom TCP Rule, Protocol: TCP, Port Range: 22, Source: (My IP) 121.211.57.221/32, Description: SSH access from home to AWS.
5. Save rules.

Followed the same steps for creating a second Security Group and Rules. Except, I entered the following details: 

  (Security Group) 
  Security group name: public-sg, Description: SSH access only from public instances on AWS, VPC: devopsacademy-vpc
  (Rules)
  Type: Custom TCP Rule, Protocol: TCP, Port Range: 22, Source (Custom) sg-01d8e1876769d1275, Description: SSH access from home to AWS.
