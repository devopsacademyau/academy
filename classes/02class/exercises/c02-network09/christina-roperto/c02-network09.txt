Security Group (SG)
Create two new security groups with attached to your new VPC with the following:

Security Group Name	    Rule	        Type	    Port Range	            Source	                Description
public-sg	            inbound	    Custom TCP Rule	    22	            <your-home-ip-address>	    SSH access from home to AWS
private-sg	            inbound	    Custom TCP Rule	    22	                <public-sg-id>	        SSH access only from public instances on AWS

post details on how did you achieve that

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- I clicked Security Groups menu on AWS console and saw that there's already a security group created by default.
- I created a new one and named it public-sg and attached my VPN (devopsacademy-vpc). Later I added the inbound rule as supplied above and chose my IP on the source, it automatically added my router's public IP (194.193.61.223/32)
- Later I did the same with the private security group and added my public-sg-id created on step 2 (sg-04e554354c82d9074)
