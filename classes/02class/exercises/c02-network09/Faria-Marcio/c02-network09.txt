--STEPS:
    On AWS console, I clicked on VPC and Security Groups. Using Create security group button, I created the first security group as follow:
	Security group name:	public-sg
	Description:		SSH access from home to AWS
	VPC:			devopsacademy-vpc

	Selecting the SG created, I chose Inbound Rules option and clicked on Edit rules button. I added a new rule as follow:
	    Type: 		Custom TCP Rule
	    Port Range: 	22
	    Source:		My IP
	    Description:	SSH access from home to AWS
	
    For the 2nd one I followed the same steps with the following details:
	Security group name:	private-sg
	Description:		SSH access only from public instances on AWS
	VPC:			devopsacademy-vpc

	Selecting the SG created, I chose Inbound Rules option and clicked on Edit rules button. I added a new rule as follow:
	    Type: 		Custom TCP Rule
	    Port Range: 	22
