Exercise 2

### Given a AWS network range, slice it in 4 small subnets and identify how many usable hosts for each one of them

# 10.0.0.0/16

I believe we can use 10.0.0.0/18 (For the 3rd Octet, but I believe there could be a few answers?)

How I worked this out is, 256 Divide 4 which gives us 64, we have 64 Bits to use.

10.0.0.0/18

10.0.64.0/18

10.0.128.0/18

10.0.192.0/18

Hosts = 16,379


# 192.168.0.0/24

Using the same methodology as above, 256 Divide by 4 (64 useable bits)

192.168.0.0/26

192.168.0.64/26

192.168.0.128/26

192.168.0.192/26

Host = 59
