Given a AWS network range, 
slice it in 4 small subnets and identify how many usable hosts for each one of them.

---
10.0.0.0/16
total available addresses: 2 pow 16 = 65536
65536 /4 = 16384 addresses
So each subnet could have 16384 addresses,
usable hosts = 16384-5 = 16379

So each subnet has 16379 usable hosts

subnet1 range: 10.0.0.4 - 10.0.63.254
subnet2 range: 10.0.64.4 - 10.0.127.254
subnet3 range: 10.0.128.4 - 10.0.191.254
subnet4 range: 10.0.192.4 - 10.0.255.254


192.168.0.0/24

total available addresses: 2 pow 8 = 256
256 /4 = 64 addresses
So each subnet could have 16384 addresses, usable hosts = 64-5 = 59

So each subnet has 59 usable hosts

subnet1 range: 192.168.0.4 - 10.0.0.62
subnet2 range: 192.168.0.68 - 192.168.0.126
subnet3 range: 1192.168.0.132 - 192.168.0.190
subnet4 range: 192.168.0.196 - 192.168.0.254
