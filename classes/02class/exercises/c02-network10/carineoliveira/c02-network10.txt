Class 02 - Exercise Network 09

Let's assume our service will need a fixed IP address and that if something happens with the instance we will have to 
move this IP address to a new one.

Create a new ENI attached to one of your private subnets and give it a fixed IP address within the network range of the 
chosen subnet.


Under EC2 -> Network Interfaces, press "Create Network Interface"
Inform a description, select a private subnet
Select Custom for IPv4 Private IP and inform the private IP 10.0.0.1
Select the default VPC security group
