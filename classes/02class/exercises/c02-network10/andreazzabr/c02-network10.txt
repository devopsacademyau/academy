## Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

Let's assume our service will need a fixed IP address and that if something happens with the instance we will have to move this IP address to a new one.

Create a new ENI attached to one of your private subnets and give it a fixed IP address within the network range of the chosen subnet.

#### post details on how did you achieve that -- note that Network Interfaces can be found on Services > Computer > EC2

aws console
ec2
network interfaces
create new
