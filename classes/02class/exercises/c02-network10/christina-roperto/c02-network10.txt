Everything is to be done preferable on Sydney region ap-southeast-2

Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
Let's assume our service will need a fixed IP address and that if something happens with the instance we will have to move this IP address to a new one.

Create a new ENI attached to one of your private subnets and give it a fixed IP address within the network range of the chosen subnet.

post details on how did you achieve that -- note that Network Interfaces can be found on Services > Computer > EC2

I went to AWS console and clicked on Network Interfaces under Network & Security on EC2 service
Created Network Interfaces and added subnet private-a. For the IPv4 I chose custom and set 10.0.1.4 (IP address within private-a subnet) and added private-sg on the security groups.
