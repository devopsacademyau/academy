-- Launch an EC2 instance on a public subnet 
    1) Attach your public SG to your public instance
	Aws Console --> Services --> EC2 --> Instances --> Launch Instance --> Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS option --> t2.micro --> Network: devopsacademy-vpc; Subnet: public-a; Auto-assign Public IP: Enable; Next: Add Storage --> Next: Add Tags --> Next: Configure Security Group --> Select an existing security group: public-sg; Review and Launch --> Launch --> Choose an existing key pair; Launch Instances

-- Launch an EC2 instance on the same private subnet that you created your ENI
    1) Attach ENI created from last exercise
    2) Attach your private SG to your public instance
	Aws Console --> Services --> EC2 --> Instances --> Launch Instance --> Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS option --> t2.micro --> Network: devopsacademy-vpc; Subnet: private-a; Auto-assign Public IP: Disable; Next: Add Storage --> Next: Add Tags --> Next: Configure Security Group --> Select an existing security group: private-sg; Review and Launch --> Launch --> Choose an existing key pair; Launch Instances

-- Access to your public instance using SSH
    Command: 	ssh -i "Devops_KeyPair.pem" ubuntu@52.65.160.47
    Return: 	ubuntu@ip-192-168-101-164:~$ 

-- FROM your PUBLIC instance, SSH to your private one
    Using WinSCP I uploaded the Devops_KeyPair.pem file to my public instance 52.65.160.47
    Command: 	chmod 400 Devops_KeyPair.pem
    Command: 	ssh -i "Devops_KeyPair.pem" ubuntu@192.168.1.199
    Return: 	ubuntu@ip-192-168-1-199:~$ 

-- Had to do any troubleshooting?
    Yes, because when I created the security group public-sg I was in a different network (public IP address) from when I tried to access the public instance. To solve this problem I changed the public-sg inbound rule to the public IP address that I was and it worked.
