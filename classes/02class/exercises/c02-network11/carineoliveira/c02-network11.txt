Class 02 - Exercise Network 11

Repeat exercise from last class where you have to:

launch an EC2 instance on a public subnet
attach your public SG to your public instance
launch an EC2 instance on the same private subnet that you created your ENI
attach ENI created from last exercise
attach your private SG to your public instance
access to your public instance using SSH
FROM your PUBLIC instance, SSH to your private one
from the PRIVATE instance, try to ping 8.8.8.8 to check internet connection through NATGW
However this time, use your custom created subnets instead of the AWS default ones.

Coommands executed to connect to both instances: 

- public connection:

- I had permission issues when trying to connect to the private instance. Error message: "Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)."
      I've solved the issue executing the following command from the folder where my .pem cerificate file were stored:
            "scp -i academy-key-pair.pem academy-key-pair.pem ec2-user@52.62.220.133:~/academy-key-pair.pem"
      It copied my .pem certificate from my local machine to my public EC2 instance 
      
      I've also executed this command "chmod 400 ~/academy-key-pair.pem" to allow read access in the instance. 

Note about chmod command above: 4 - read | 2 - write | 1 - run
e.g.
      - 400: read access
      - 600: read + write
      - 700: read + write + run
