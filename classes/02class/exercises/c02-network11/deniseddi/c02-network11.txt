I had 1 issue and 1 troubleshooting. 

After creating my first instance, I noticed the Public DNS (IPv4) was not showing. After googling the issue (stack overflow), I went to VPC, then Your VPCs, selected Action -> Edit DNS Hostnames -> Changed DNS Hostnames to “Yes”. Issue solved. 

However, the instance would not connect. I had a look on the AWS docs, where it refers to "General Prerequisites for Connecting to your Instance" and suspected my troubleshooting had to do with my Security Groups. Looked at the details of my public security group (public-sg) and found that my Inbound Rules had as Source “sg- …”, which looked more like my Security Group ID. Edited it to “MY IP” (as per my notes on exercise 09) saved it. Tried to connect my instance again and it worked! Not sure what happened before…maybe I did not hit “save” while doing my exercise.

Created second Instance, Left Auto-assign Public IP as Disable. Attached ENI and private-sg. 

From my Public instance, SSH to my private one like so: 

-	ssh -A -i /Users/denisegomes/Downloads/denise_admin_keypair3.pem ec2-user@ec2-13-211-130-133.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
-	ssh ec2-user@10.0.0.4

All good!
