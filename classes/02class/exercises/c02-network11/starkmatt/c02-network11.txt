##Exercisse 11

Had some EC2 Instances created already.
I switch them both off and then created what was required from the exercise.

- EC2 Dashboard, Navigate to Instance on the left hand side and then select (Amazon Linux AMI 2018 w/ Containers)
Used the Free-Tier selections,
Select my existing VPC Intstance (devopsacademy) and then attached my public-sg / subnet (to the Instance subnet-0172d4b0dc94ea5cc)
After the Instance created,
I SSH'd into the host using the following;

ssh -i "starkmatt-box.pem" ec2-user@54.252.179.170
Was running into issues initally.
After some time of troubleshooting found out that the route table named "devopsacademy-rt-public" was routing to a NAT Gateway and not the IGW, after fixing this I was able to connect to the public instance fine.

From here, I then prepared to connect to the private instance.
I first added the key using ssh-keygen.
Afer this was created, I then tried to SSH using ssh -i "key.pem" but the Public key was rejected.
"Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)"

After some digging, I then checked the private key in the public EC2 Instance with the one on my desktop at home.
Made a few changes, and then tried to SSH Again.
No deal, I then moved the public key into another folder and then added the public key in the authorized_key file in the .ssh folder located in ec2-user/home
After that, all working! (Wohoo)

ec2-user@ip-10-0-190-4 ~]$ ssh -i "starkmatt-box.pem" ec2-user@10.0.64.10
