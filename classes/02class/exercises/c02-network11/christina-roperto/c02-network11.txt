AWS VPC + subnets
Commit all your answers to a text file c02-network11.txt under your folder name.

Everything is to be done preferable on Sydney region ap-southeast-2

EC2
Repeat exercise from last class where you have to:

launch an EC2 instance on a public subnet
attach your public SG to your public instance
launch an EC2 instance on the same private subnet that you created your ENI
attach ENI created from last exercise
attach your private SG to your public instance
access to your public instance using SSH
FROM your PUBLIC instance, SSH to your private one
However this time, use your custom created subnets instead of the AWS default ones.

post if you had to do any troubleshooting or if that worked straight away
DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE YOUR RESOURCES ONCE YOU FINISH:
ALL EC2 INSTANCES
NAT GATEWAY
ANY ELASTIC IP (those are charged only if you allocate one and is not being used)
You can leave the vpc, subnets, route tables, internet gateway, network acl

Launched an EC2 instance on subnet public-access
- chose default free AMI (Amazon Linux 2 AMI) and free tier instance type (t2 micro)
- verified the network is devopsacademy-vpc
- chose use subnet setting (Enable) on the auto-assign public ip
- on the last step, attached public-sg
- selected an existing keypair
- connecting via ssh using the command: ssh -i "ChristinaAWS.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-252-160-136.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
- connected and ran yum update



Launched an EC2 instance on the same private subnet that you created your ENI
- same with the the public subnet but disable auto assign public IP and attached private-sg
- connected the private subnet through public subnet using agent forwarding: 
ssh -A -i "ChristinaAWS.pem" ec2-user@ec2-54-252-160-136.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com
then connect the private subnet: ssh ec2-user@10.0.1.4



I had this Issue when connecting via ssh, I chose yes but not sure if that's normal: 
The authenticity of host 'ec2-54-252-160-136.ap-southeast-2.compute.amazonaws.com (54.252.160.136)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:0GMFyH+fTNvd0xCSnwnJ7fAJFQNEKZaf+HrcQSU3aFQ.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
