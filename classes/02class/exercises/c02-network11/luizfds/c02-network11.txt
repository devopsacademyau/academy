I didn't have any problem to troubleshooting doing this exercise and I didn't attach my private SG to my public instance, I attached to my private one though.

Detailed steps below:

I create two Amazon Linux AMI 2018.03.0 EC2 instances, the first one I called `public-ec2` and associated it with my subnet `subnet-0193e5523b68fdcb5` (public-a) and with my SG called `public-sg`. The second instance, called `private-ec2` was associated with my subnet `subnet-0dc1499994fed9007` (private-a), SG `private-sg` and with my ENI called `devopsacademy-eni`. 

After both EC2 machines was up and running I accessed my public EC2 instance using the folowing command:

  ~ ssh -i ~/devopsacademyau/ec2/devopsacademy.pem ec2-user@54.206.113.249
  The authenticity of host '54.206.113.249 (54.206.113.249)' can't be established.
  ECDSA key fingerprint is SHA256:G7aVCYt/c1e+HGN6uMkuHsOq8y5DTeZAZfGy5tFjPoM.
  Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
  Warning: Permanently added '54.206.113.249' (ECDSA) to the list of known hosts.

  Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.


And to access my private EC2 Instance I chose to use a ProxyCommand in ssh.
First I added a ssh config file with my secure host (private instance) and my jump host or bastion host (public instance), see config details below:

  vi ~/.ssh/config

  Host jumphost
    HostName 54.206.113.249 
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile ~/devopsacademyau/ec2/devopsacademy.pem
    ProxyCommand none
  Host securehost
    HostName 10.0.0.4 
    User ec2-user 
    IdentityFile ~/devopsacademyau/ec2/devopsacademy.pem
    ProxyCommand ssh jumphost -W %h:%p

Then to login to my private machine from my laptop using the jumphost I used ssh securehost

  âžœ  ~ ssh securehost
