Internet Gateway (IGW)
Create an Internet Gateway called devopsacademy-igw and attach it to your devopsacademy-vpc VPC.

Post how did you accomplish that on AWS console.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

when I clicked Internet Gateways tab, I saw that an Internet Gateway has been created already and is attached to vpc-06763d321855b5d7b | devopsacademy-vpc
I detached the devopsacademy-vpc from that Internet Gateway and created another one with name devopsacademy-igw. In retrospect I could have just renamed the one created already.
