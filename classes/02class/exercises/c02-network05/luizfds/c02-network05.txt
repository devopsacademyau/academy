To create an internet gateway called `devopsacademy-igw` and then attach it to my previously created VPC I followed these steps:
    1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
    2. In the navigation pane, choose Internet Gateways, and then choose Create internet gateway.
    3. Optionally name your internet gateway (I named as `devopsacademy-igw`), and then choose Create.
    4. Select the internet gateway that you just created, and then choose Actions, Attach to VPC.
    5. Select your VPC from the list, and then choose Attach.
