## Commands Execution Output

For the exercises below, you should use all the custom created network resources. NOT THE DEFAULT ONES.

- Provide commands used to go through all the below deliverables: (everything should be done using the AWS cli)

  - explain how was the process to create a VPC peering
  - add routes from origin VPC to target VPC - only for private subnets
  - open any network ACL to allow the connection within the subnets -- try to   only open the mininum required
  - from an instance in one vpc, SSH to the other instance (will have to share   the ssh keys, create a new one just for this exercise -- pay attention to   security)
  - open any security group to allow the SSH communication between the   instances

```
