- explain how was the process to create a VPC peering
I teamed up with Christina to be able to finish this exercise. She configured and sent to me a VPC peering invitation that and then I accepted.

- add routes from origin VPC to target VPC - only for private subnets
I added a new record at my route table `devopsacademy-rt-public` with Christina EC2 instance IP `192.168.0.0/16` and the target was our vpc peering `pcx-06fe6ee73bb4bdca1`. She did the same at her end to be able to connect with my VPC.

- open any network ACL to allow the connection within the subnets -- try to only open the mininum required
Christina did this configuration at her end allowing my private IP `10.0.1.251` to access her VPC.

- from an instance in one vpc, SSH to the other instance (will have to share the ssh keys, create a new one just for this exercise -- pay attention to security)

- open any security group to allow the SSH within the instances

- explain any learnings from this process
