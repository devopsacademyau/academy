- Commands for creating the following routes:

|route table|destination|target|
|-|-|-|
|devopsacademy-rt-public|0.0.0.0|`devopsacademy-igw`|
|devopsacademy-rt-private|0.0.0.0|`devopsacademy-ngw`|

```
$ aws ec2 create-route \
    --route-table-id rtb-0509a3a7e72e606fd --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --gateway-id igw-089944037834c5e28

{
    "Return": true
}

$ aws ec2 create-route \
    --route-table-id rtb-0fd603c6c542d8aaf --destination-cidr-block 0.0.0.0/0 --nat-gateway-id nat-01dfd6d7bc743054d

{
    "Return": true
}
```

- Answer the following questions:
  - How did you accomplish both instructions?
    ```
    By checking the AWS CLI documentation and taking note of the appropriate igw, nat, rtb, vpc, and subnet ids for each command.
    ```

  - Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the IGW on public route table?
    ```
    To allow hosts deployed in the public subnets to access the Internet and be publicly accessible.
    ```

  - Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the NGW on private route table?
    ```
    To allow hosts deployed in the private subnets to access the Internet without being publicly accessible.
    ```
    
  - What is the difference of IGW and NGW?
    ```
    IGW is designed to allow hosts inside a VPC to be publicly accessible, NGW is designed to allow hosts to access the Internet preventing public hosts to initiate inbound connections.
    ```
    
  - Can you delete the destination route to your VPC network? Why?
    ```
    - Every route table contains a local route for communication within the VPC.
    - You cannot modify or delete these routes in a subnet route table or in the main route table.
    - AWS doesn't allow the deletion of local routes, and if it was possible to do so, it would disrupt the communication between resources deployed in the same VPC or subnets.
    ```
    
  - What happens if you do not associate your route table with any subnets?
    ```
    - A route table without any association is useless.
    - The RT association must be in place to allow traffic from subnets or gateways to be routed according to the routes in the route table.
    ```

- Any extra challenges faced?
    I got a better understanding on route table concepts, default behaviors and allowed actions.
