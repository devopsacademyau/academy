--ROUTE TABLE (rt)
    Post how did you accomplish that on AWS console:
	On AWS console, I clicked on VPC and select the Route Tables option, then I used the Create route table button to create the devopsacademy-rt-private and devopsacademy-rt-private route tables.
	After creating them I associated the private subnets to devopsacademy-rt-private and the public subnets to devopsacademy-rt-private route table by clicking on them and using the Edit subnet associations button.

-- ROUTES
    How did you accomplish both instructions?
	On each of the Route tables created I clicked on Routes and used the Edit routes button to add devopsacademy-igw in devopsacademy-rt-public and devopsacademy-ngw in devopsacademy-rt-private.

    Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the IGW on public route table?
	It is done to the public hosts be able to access the internet.

    Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the NGW on private route table?
	It is done to the private hosts be able to access the internet.

    What is the difference of IGW and NGW? 1)
	IGW is a logical connection between an Amazon VPC and the Internet. If a VPC does not have an Internet Gateway, the resources in the VPC cannot be accessed from the Internet.
	NGW is used to forward traffic to the Internet. Therefore, instances in a private subnet that want to access the Internet can have their Internet-bound traffic forwarded to the NGW via a Route Table configuration.

    Can you delete the destination route to your VPC network? Why?
	No, because it is the local route and it is used as the default route.

    What happens if you do not associate your route table with any subnets?
	The main route table is used by default when it is not associated with any other route table.
