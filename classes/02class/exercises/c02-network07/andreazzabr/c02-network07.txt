How did you accomplish both instructions?
Aws console - vpc - route tables - new route table - Name tag - vpc.

Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the IGW on public route table?
So my public hosts can access internet

Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the NGW on private route table?
So my private hosts can access internet

What is the difference of IGW and NGW?
IGW gives access to public-hosts to the internet
NGW gives access to private-hosts to the internet

Can you delete the destination route to your VPC network? Why?
Local network? No, otherwise you canâ€™t reach any other machine locally.

What happens if you do not associate your route table with any subnets?
Then the subnets will be implicit associated with the main route table.
