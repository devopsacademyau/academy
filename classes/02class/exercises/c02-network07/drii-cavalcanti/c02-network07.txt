1. How did you accomplish both instructions?
   
   Routes tables -> Create route table
   Name tag: devopsacademy-rt-public     | devopsacademy-rt-private
   VPC: devopsacademy-vpc                | devopsacademy-vpc
   Route Table ID: rtb-0e207eae762680d7c | rtb-0eb05e1f99f327b29
   
   === Setting all subnets to the new route tables ==================
   Select subnet -> Route table -> Edit route table association
   public-a | devopsacademy-rt-public
   public-b | devopsacademy-rt-public   

   === Editing routes ===============================================
   Select route table -> Edit routes
   Name: devopsacademy-rt-public | devopsacademy-rt-public 
   Destination: 0.0.0.0/0        | 0.0.0.0/0
   Target: devopsacademy-igw     | devopsacademy-ngw

2. Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the IGW on public route table?
   To scope the route for the internet gateway to ALL destinations not explicitly known to the route table.

3. Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the NGW on private route table?
   It routes ALL IPv4 internet traffic to the NAT device.

4. What is the difference of IGW and NGW?
   Basically, an IGW is used for setting a subnet as a public subnet which will be able to access to the internet directly. On the other hand, a NGW will be used to create a route for a private subnet to be able to access to the internet throught a public subnet.   

5. Can you delete the destination route to your VPC network? Why?
   We cannot modify and even delete the destination route to your VPC network. Because the local route is a default route for communication within the VPC.
   
6. What happens if you do not associate your route table with any subnets?
   They will obey the main route table.
