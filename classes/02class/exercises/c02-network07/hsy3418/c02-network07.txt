- How did you accomplish both instructions?
Navigate to VPC->Route tables->Create route table. 
Name the route table and select the VPC.
After it's been created, click on the routes options,
Then edit routes->Add route with the 
destinateion:0.0.0.0/0 target:devopsacademy-igw 
Create another route table and follow the same way and add route
destinateion:0.0.0.0/0 target:devopsacademy-ngw

- Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the IGW on public route table?
It is a default route and basic telling anything in the subnet 
the default way of getting out of the subnet is via the IGW

- Why did you add 0.0.0.0 route to the NGW on private route table?
It is a default route for the resources in private subnets 
to be able to communicate with the internet through NGW

- What is the difference of IGW and NGW?
  IGW allows communication between instances in the VPC and the internet,
  a route need to be added to public subnets route table and make the IGW as a target. 
  
  NGW allows things in private subnets are able to talk to the internet, but it only allows
  responses to requests that come from inside, if the requests come from the internet and tries to 
  get through NGW, it will get rejects. a route need to be added to the private subnets route table and make the
  NGW as a target.

- Can you delete the destination route to your VPC network? Why?
No, this route allows the resources within the VPC can talk to each other.

- What happens if you do not associate your route table with any subnets?
The subnets will be associated with the main route table
