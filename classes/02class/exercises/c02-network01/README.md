# IP Addressing

### For each given IPv4 address and network prefix (CIDR), please determine:

- IP in binary
- subnet in binary
- subnet in decimals
- is it private or public?
- how many IP addresses for HOSTS are available on subnets (not necessarily AWS ones) -- if you wish to do for AWS subnets type, just state your decision.

- Example: `192.168.0.1/24`

IP in binary: `11000000.10101000.00000000 .00000001`
subnet in binary: `11111111.11111111.11111111 .00000000`
subnet in decimals: `255.255.255.0`
private/public: `private`
hosts: `251`

- 10.0.0.1/24
- 192.168.0.1/16
- 249.165.166.135/30
- 236.68.223.18/32
- 172.31.0.0/16
