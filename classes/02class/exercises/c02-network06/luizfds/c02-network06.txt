To create a NAT gateway, I need to specify a subnet and an Elastic IP address not associated with an instance or a network interface. 
To accomplish this exercise I've followed these steps:
    1. Open the Amazon VPC console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/.
    2. In the navigation pane, choose NAT Gateways, Create NAT Gateway.
    3. Specify the subnet in which to create the NAT gateway (I've selected my subnet called `public-a`), and select the allocation ID of an Elastic IP address to associate with the NAT gateway (I didn't had any Elastic IP created so I had to assign an Elastic IP address by clicking the button 'Allocate Elastic IP address'). When you're done, choose Create a NAT Gateway.
    4. The NAT gateway displays in the console. After a few moments, its status changes to Available, after which it's ready for you to use.
    5. Then I named my NAT Gateway as `devopsacademy-ngw`.
