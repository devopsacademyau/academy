NAT Gateway (NGW) (optional)
Be aware that NAT Gateway is out of the free-tier. If you just use it while you are doing your exercises and MAKE SURE TO DELETE afterwards it should incurr less than 1$ cost. We highly recommend you testing this step but we understand if you decide not to.

Create a NAT Gateway called devopsacademy-ngw and attach it to one of your public subnets (any) with an Elastic IP.

Post how did you accomplish that on AWS console.
DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE YOUR RESOURCES ONCE YOU FINISH
