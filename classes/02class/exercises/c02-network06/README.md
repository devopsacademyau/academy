# AWS VPC + subnets

Commit all your answers to a text file `c02-network06.txt` under your folder name.

Everything is to be done preferable on Sydney region `ap-southeast-2`

## NAT Gateway (NGW) (optional)

Be aware that NAT Gateway is out of the free-tier. If you just use it while you are doing your exercises and MAKE SURE TO DELETE afterwards it should incurr less than 1$ cost. We highly recommend you testing this step but we understand if you decide not to.

Create a NAT Gateway called `devopsacademy-ngw` and attach it to one of your public subnets (any) with an Elastic IP. 

#### Post how did you accomplish that on AWS console.

#### DO NOT FORGET TO DELETE YOUR RESOURCES ONCE YOU FINISH
