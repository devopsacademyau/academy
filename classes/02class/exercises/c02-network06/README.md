# AWS VPC + subnets

Everything is to be done preferable on Sydney region `ap-southeast-2`

## NAT Gateway (NGW) (optional)

Be aware that NAT Gateway is out of the free-tier. If you just use it while you are doing your exercises and MAKE SURE TO DELETE afterwards it should incurr less than 1$ cost. We highly recommend you testing this step but we understand if you decide not to.

Create a NAT Gateway called `devopsacademy-ngw` and attach it to one of your public subnets (any) with an Elastic IP.
