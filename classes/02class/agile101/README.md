# Class 02

This class is an introduction to Agile methodology and frameworks.

The main goal is to explain the difference between sequential life cycle software development and iterative ones. 

There is also a brief introduction to Scrum and Kanban frameworks.

### Software Development Methodologies and Frameworks 

#### What is Waterfall methodology?

Waterfall Model methodology which is also known as Liner Sequential Life Cycle Model. Waterfall Model followed in the sequential order, and so project development team only moves to next phase of development or testing if the previous step completed successfully. [[1]](#r1)

*Waterfall example [[2]](#r2)*

> How do you do with always-changing requirements while using a waterfall methodology?
> How often you test and release?

#### What is the Agile methodology?
Agile methodology is a practice that helps continuous iteration of development and testing in the software development process. In this model, development and testing activities are concurrent, unlike the Waterfall model. This process allows more communication between customers, developers, managers, and testers.

Agile is part of a larger group of [Iterative Methodologies](https://existek.com/blog/sdlc-models/) that exist since 90's, like IBM RUP (Rational Unified Process), RAD, DAD (Discipled Agile Delivery).

**So, what's agility?**

The problems faced with Waterfall and similar methodologies, come down to delivering value faster.

> Value, in software, means any software component that **achieves or supports business goals, present and future**, and that has an **affordable cost to operate and change** with new business requirements.

The fact here is that business is ever changing to keep up with the competition or innovate, and software needs to quickly adapt and support these new scenarios.

It does not matter much if the final product is a software product or if the IT area is just supporting the business goals (e.g. banking, healthcare, energy, etc). It needs to keep up with the business, meaning that it needs to bring more money in or reduce costs [(Read about Kaizen)](https://blog.kainexus.com/improvement-disciplines/kaizen/best-practices-for-effective-kaizen-management)!

**So, what changes in terms of Software Development Life Cycle?**

We need to iterate more with a smaller set of requirements that bring value to the business!

***Lean thinking:***

The term “lean thinking” was coined by  James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones to capture the essence of their in-depth study of Toyota's fabled Toyota Production System.

Lean thinking is a way of thinking about an activity and seeing the waste inadvertently generated by the way the process is organized. It uses the concepts of:

- Value
- Value streams
- Flow

[from less.works](https://less.works/less/principles/lean-thinking.html)
  > Consider a relay race. The racers are standing around waiting for the baton from their colleague. The accountant in the finance department, looking aghast at this terrible underutilization ‘waste,’ would probably mandate a policy goal of “95% utilization of resources” to ensure all the racers are busy and “productive.” Maybe—he would suggest—the runners could run three races at the same time to increase “resource utilization,” or they could run up a mountain while waiting for the baton.

  > Does your organization measure “productivity” or “efficiency” in terms of how busy people are, or how much time is spent watching the runners? Or does it measure “productivity” in terms of fast delivery of value to the real customer, thereby “watching the baton”? 

  Lean thinking is a proven system that scales to large development, as evidenced by Toyota and others. Although most often applied to products, it is also used in service areas—both within Toyota and in domains such as healthcare. 

### How about DevOps?

If you are a Software Developer, some Agile practices might be part of your routine already (it should be at this day and age).

But it is common to see that companies that didn't embrace a new different development culture (Agile or DevOps) might still have **separate Teams (or even Managing Directors) for Development and Operations**.

> So, what do you do after your team followed beautifully all of the Agile best practices and delivered a feature?
> **Someone needs to maintain it (Operation guys)!**

So, DevOps is all about culture!

It is a way of organising teams to deliver value through software, tearing down the walls left behind by Agile methodologies.

*Agile and DevOps work together as a cultural change* [[4]](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/blogs-reshma-shinde-devops-transformations-operations)

> As it is a cultural change, people need to change actions, processes need to evolve!

### Agile Frameworks
#### Kanban
The major differences between Scrum and Kanban is that in Scrum work is divided into sprints that last a fixed amount of time, whereas in Kanban the flow of work is continuous. This is visible in work stage tables, which in Scrum are emptied after each sprint, whereas in Kanban all tasks are marked on the same table. Scrum focuses on teams with multifaceted know-how, whereas Kanban makes specialized, functional teams possible.

#### Scaled Agile frameworks

When working in an Enterprise composed by many teams, with well defined process for change management, portfolio/project management and valuation, capacity management, compliance and regulation auditing, etc., this Agile methodologies need to scale so several teams work in harmony to achieve the strategic Enterprise goals.


There some variations of the Scrum framework, as:
