The refreshed state will be used to calculate this plan, but will not be
persisted to local or remote state storage.

Plan: 6 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Note: You didn't specify an "-out" parameter to save this plan, so Terraform
can't guarantee that exactly these actions will be performed if
"terraform apply" is subsequently run.
