# Describe the RDS Instance (c04-rds02)

In this exercise, we'll use the same database created in the [last exercise](../c04/rds01).

You'll need to describe the instance configuration as well as delete the RDS instance using the `aws cli` . 

## Submit a PR with the following files:
- README.md based on the [ANSWER.md file](ANSWER.md) with a link to all files from your answer. The links are already in the ANSWER.md file, but if you have any additional files, include a link to it.
- db-description.txt with the output of the aws cli command to describe the RDS instance.
- db-deletion.txt with the command and the output of the cli command to delete the db security group and the database instance. Any other resource that you've created must be deleted and the command and its output added to this file.
