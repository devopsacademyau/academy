# C04-IAC04

## Command Execution Output
- [output.txt](output.txt)
- [terraform-apply.txt](terraform-apply.txt)
- [terraform-code/](terraform-code/)

## Questions:
- What is the benefit of having the Terraform code for the resources within the module you've created?
    - It gives you a layer of abstraction and flexibility to reuse the same module with different environments by giving different set of variables as per requirement.
      The variables and outputs can vary as per the environment, however the same set of resources are used.
