## Questions:
- What is the benefit of having the Terraform code for the resources within the module you've created?
    Modules in terraform can be logically split and reused like functions. you can easily deploy different environments by simply changing the tfvars file (ie one with variables for a prod system, one with vaariables for a dev system).
