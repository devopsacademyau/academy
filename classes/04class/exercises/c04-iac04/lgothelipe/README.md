## Questions:
- What is the benefit of having the Terraform code for the resources within the module you've created?
    - Modules can be reused like functions on any code language. It is possible to input and extract variables from modules.
	Modules can be used to create lightweight abstractions, but over-using modules can make the overall Terraform configuration harder to understand and maintain.
